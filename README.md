This repo contains the source for my site. I've adapted the template of [Start Bootstrap's](http://startbootstrap.com/) [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) because I'm a lazy piece of shit.

Automatically deployed to my web server via [https://ftploy.com/](https://ftploy.com/dashboard).

## Bugs and Issues

Have a bug or an issue with this template? Open an issue against the repo and I'll fix it.

## Creator

This was adapted by me. You can reach me on Twitter here:

Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
