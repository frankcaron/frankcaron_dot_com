                I stood amongst a crowd of concert-goers. Some were content to
                live in the moment with bodies asway and eyes closed while each
                loud bass kick sent a visible ripple of sheer ecstasy through
                their bodies. Others were content to merely record the moment,
                faces hid behind lit phone and camera screens watching the event
                that unfolded before them in the third-person.

                I couldn’t bring myself to be the latter for more than a second.
                I knew I was in the midst of a dream, and I didn’t want to
                surrender even a moment of it for the sake of reliving it later.

                For the first time in years, I wanted the present to remain the
                present. I dreamed not of the future nor was subjugated by the
                past. I was living, and cherishing, the present as it unfolded.
              </p>
              <p name="eb5a" id="eb5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Damning thing about the present, though, is that you can’t
                control its speed.

                We had separated for the moment, and I schmoozed with the crowd
                around me to find that feeling of comfort and effortless
                companionship I’d enjoyed moments prior. Some considered me a
                schmoozer by trade, but the reality was that I felt truly
                comfortable with very few.

                After enjoying another of the DJ’s serenades, I decided to
                replenish my liquids, so I slowly made my way through the
                tightly-packed crowd towards the bar, accidentally rubbing and
                being rubbed against hungrily by Mollys as though I were the
                baggy they were passing around earlier in the evening. When I
                finally emerged from the amoebic body of dancers, I was able to
                take but a breath before finding myself again in the midst of a
                schmooze.

                “Bro!”, he yelled as he approached me. Spilly, I’d dubbed him,
                had spilt a drink on me earlier in the night, and he quickly
                made reparations by buying me one at the time. Feeling content
                to play my role as high-rolling schmoozer, I returned him the
                favour in good humor.

                For the moment, we bonded, and when he asked me if I knew where
                to score some drugs, I found myself surprisingly contented — it
                was a quick hit of camaraderie, my drug of choice.

                Little did I know I’d get it in spades one second later, as two
                British girls spotted me and immediately grabbed me by the arm
                while spouting words that I could neither hear nor understand.
                I, easily charmed, followed along. It was only after one latched
                herself around me and warmed my neck with her breath that I
                understood: they’d found, as she put it, “my girl”, and they
                were trying to reunite us.

                The beginning of “Language”, the headlining track of the entire
                event, had started playing at this point.

                The girls dragged me back into the center of the dance floor,
                searching for their friends who were with “my girl”. They led me
                by the hand, and for the time being, I regressed to boyhood,
                being led blindly by strangers with the trust that I’d find home
                again after becoming lost.

                Weaving through the crowd, they carved a path towards home. They
                pushed. They pulled. They frantically searched around. We
                couldn’t find them. We couldn’t find her friends. We went right.
                We went left. We used people as reference. There, by the weird
                hat guy! No, there, by Glowsticks McGee! No! We’ll find them!
                Hope. We’ll never find them. Despair. Come this way, she yelled.
                Then, no no, that way. It was hopeless; it’s not hopeless! And
                then, she’d screamed, Oh my god, there they are!

                The crowd opened to reveal what it held as a pearl in its
                clamshell, and there she was: a brilliant starburst piercing
                through the darkness of the club floor.
              </p>
              <p name="3b3f" id="3b3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                How I long to be able to freeze that moment as a tableau
                forevermore. The crowd held still; the once-schizophrenic lights
                statically targeting a single point; airborne and askew
                glowsticks hovering motionlessly; smiles, laughs, cheers — all
                held in stasis. It is eerily quiet and yet appropriately devoid
                of distraction.

                We stand across from one another, my face reflecting the
                surprise upon our nigh-infinite separation coming to a welcome
                end. But hers is what I want to remember. Eyes alight, grin
                forming, hair jostled perfectly as to suggest excitement, body
                mid-stride towards me and only me.

                We were flawed in many ways. We’d each our own bank’s worth of
                insecurities, issues, regrets, and torments, locked safely
                behind vault doors to which we held the combinations dear. We
                were on two seperate vectors of life.

                But in that moment of intersection, that simple and glorious
                second, we were perfection incarnate. We were whole and again
                together, free from any thought or worry or strife or
                preoccupation other than the euphoric glory of having found the
                one we lost. It was a high the likes of which no manmade
                substance nor product of nature can offer — the type of moment,
                the only type, with the power to create and destroy love.

                to give time its due right to proceed just as the crescendo of
                event’s title track enacted the synesthesia that would, to my
                great surprise and delight and eternal gratefulness, freeze the
                moment forever in my mind.
