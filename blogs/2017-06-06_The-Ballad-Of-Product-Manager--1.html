                I totally changed my focus and I was renewed. I began to listen
                and observe and when prompted began providing business insights,

                based on my experience.

                contacts and customers that could do that for me where I
                couldn’t. I resisted the urge to dictate and instead directed. I
                helped the team to discover rather than to be discouraged.
