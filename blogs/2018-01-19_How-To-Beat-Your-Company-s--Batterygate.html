                  Prospects (active and passive) are just as important as
                  customers — if and only if you know how, and when, to listen
                  to them.

                I could go on (and I probably will in another post at some
                point), but above all else, the lesson I’ve learned most

                There are many reasons why this is true, but if you approach
                your business like this, you’re eventually going to have
                something blow up on you. And when it does, you’re going to fuck
                up your response to it. And you’re going to do so because you
                act from a place of feeling you’re smarter than your customers.

                You might argue that Apple took the brunt of the battery
                blowback simply because it’s “the biggest brand”.

                Yet, it has never before been hit so hard, so fast, with so much
                fervor about the issue, and that’s why I believe Apple could
                have avoided this.

                How Apple Failed
              </h3>
              <p name="ab69" id="ab69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                Apple’s big failure here was rooted, perhaps ironically, in the
                same behaviour that has made it successful in its product
                marketing and advertising efforts previously.
              </p>
              <p name="ccef" id="ccef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Apple’s go-to-market approach is aimed towards, and
                predominantly messages to, a consumer-base that it considers
                largely uneducated about tech.
              </p>
              <p name="92d1" id="92d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Indeed, somewhere buried within a Keynote presentation at the
                Cupertino campus exists a group of personas ranging from the
                “average preteen in middle America” to the “New York Wall Street
                hedgefund manager”.
              </p>
              <p name="af8d" id="af8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The tie that binds these personas? A fundamental belief (born
                from Apple’s understanding of user pain) that their device
                “should just work”, with the underlying assumptive corrollary of
                “…and I don’t care how it does”.

              <p name="9781" id="9781" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                But that deck must be dated 2010, stagnant and unrepresentative
                of the market now shifted — and that corrollary is where the
                issue stems.

                As the prices of personal technology have climbed, so too has
                consumers’ general, literal, and emotional investment in the
                devices that line their person.

                As phones have gotten faster, thinner, bigger, lighter, only one
                major area of innovation remains largely untapped: the battery.
                Batteries haven’t gotten much better, and our expectations of
                battery life reflect that.

                We’ve all felt the pang of the red battery icon. And that’s a

                batterygate is so triggering.

                There’s a well-worn idiom in the world of product development
                for when something goes wrong in a somewhat useful way: we like
                to say “it’s not a bug; it’s a feature”.
              </p>
              <p name="0b17" id="0b17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I’ve always considered that statement to be a perfect example of
                why product marketing is so important: it’s all in how you
                position your features.

              <p name="caaf" id="caaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Apple chose a very deliberate positioning for battery management
                in iOS, particularly in the last few releases: it deemed the
                topic too “unsexy” to discuss or build around. Wireless charging
                is way cooler and a more “sellable” problem to the battery
                issue, the company thought.

                But with an understanding for a user’s pain (“my battery sucks
                and as my phone gets older, it keeps randomly dying on me”) and
                with respect for a user’s interest in the matter (as well as
                their high-level understanding of the tech in their phone), the
                company’s go-to-market for its new battery tech should’ve looked

                By working the battery tech into a “feature”, rather than having
                it manifest to user as a “bug”, the company could have shaped

                In Apple’s underestimation of its consumer base, and what they

                far less money.
