                over the years. I’d estimate that I’ve resold somewhere between
                150 and 200 different electronics and pieces of furniture since
                moving to Toronto in 2008.

                As the sheer number might suggest, I’m not a loyalist to any one
                of those platforms. Generally speaking, I want to get stuff gone
                as fast as possible for the highest amount possible. I like to
                cross-post my wares in the hopes of moving them quickly, but I
                tend to forgo doing so on platforms that don’t prove fruitful.

                There’s much to be said about which of these is the most
                effective, and I should probably spend some time writing out my
                thoughts on the lot — particularly with the recent entrance of

                Alas, with immediate need to move a couple of items and a mind
                for speed being the only present concern, I decided to do a test
                and see which of the platforms would win said battle of
                speed-to-sale.

                I decided to clean out my den of a few pieces of tech before the

                time.

                I decided to compare the sales of three related items:

              <ul class="postList">
                <li name="c45d" id="c45d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
                  A 16 GB iPhone 4

                <li name="ee80" id="ee80" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
                  A Lifeproof Fre iPhone 5S case

                  A Microsoft Zune

              </ul>
              <p name="0336" id="0336" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">
                For simplicity’s sake, I priced all of the items at $40 each.
                I’d thought that the 5S case was the most desirable of the lot
                and was the most likely to sell first, as the value is clear at
                the price point (given that the case retails for $100), but I
                seriously underestimated people’s willingness to buy the iPhone
                4, I learned.

                Within 15 minutes, I’d gotten my first ping: a young lady
                expressed interest in the iPhone 4. The lead generator? Kijiji.

              <p name="931c" id="931c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The second came from Craigslist, from a motivated buyer, but he
                unfortunately was looking for an unlocked iPhone 4.

                About an hour later, I got a ping on my phone. It was a direct
                message from a buyer on Varage Sale. Unlike the other platforms,
                the conversation wasn’t via email but rather the platform’s IM.
                We were able to hash things out pretty quickly and arranged to
                meet by a subway station.

                After some back and forth, and a brief wait, though, the Varage
                Sale buyer declined.

                What subsequently followed was a stream of emails expressing
                interest in all of the items coming from a split of Craig’ers
                and Kijij’ers.

                At this point, the requests for the iPhone picked up steam via
                Varage Sale, but after another day and 20 or so more emails from
                Craigslist and Kijiji, a Kijij’er scooped it up with a pick up
                right at my house.

                Within 48 hours, I’d moved two out of the three items, and both

                Based on this completely non-scientific and anecdotal
                experience, it’s clear that Kijiji is by far the most effective
                sales platform today, at least when it comes to speed-to-sale.

                This is perhaps an obvious result because it’s the natural
                outcome of having the biggest membership base in Toronto; more
                members = more

                However, there’s one interesting thing to note: Kijiji net a lot
                of leads, but many were what I’ll call “unqualified”.

                Almost all of the emails I received asked “clarifying” questions
                that were redundant if you took the time to read the actual
                posting, and only 2 out of the 25 net the sale.

                On the other hand, the Varage Sale leads were all interested and
                made direct contact immediately, but they simply decided not to
                proceed with the purchase after price negotiation or discussion
                with family.

                From my sellers perspective, then, it seems like Varage Sale was
                actually
                <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"
                  >more effective than Craigslist</strong
                >
                in this regard, particularly because Craigslist only produced 3
                dead-end leads with what I would’ve expected to be a bigger
                memberbase than Varage Sale.

                Perhaps given more time, though, one of the two would have net a
                conversion and settled the debate.

                All told, Varage Sale is a welcome newcomer to the classifieds
                game, and to be quite honest, between it and Kijiji, ditching
                Craigslist altogether is my present consideration, as I had too
                previously done with eBay and Reddit. Sure, Craigslist is free,
                but it seems like Toronto has spoken when it comes to Craigslist
                vs. Kijiji.

                As for the long-term potential of Varage Sale as a platform, the
                jury’s out, but so far, I like what the service has to offer.
                Building the memberbase and improving the search tools will do
                wonders, and I’d be very curious to see how this test would turn
                out a year from now.
