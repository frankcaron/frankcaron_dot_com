                Here’s a fun fact about me: I have a thing for good commercials.
                Okay, a “thing” is a bit of an understatement: I’m obsessed with
                good commercials. I fawn over them. I force my friends to watch
                them. I dissect them and discuss them in lengthy diatribes.

                I believe commercials to be the haiku of modern story-telling,
                as with similar constraints comes similar functional beauty when
                done well. Telling a compelling story in 60 seconds is fucking
                hard, but when done right, those stories can compel action and
                persuade masses like no other.

                While technology-wise the phone is somewhat interesting — its
                e-ink display and slim form factor are as alluring as its
                minimalistic operating system — the product is receiving
                widespread acclaim and adoption for one reason and one reason
                alone.

                Most great products are born from customer insights. Great
                product companies have for decades done everything possible to
                connect with customers, to discover new problems, and to deliver
                compelling solutions.
              </p>
              <p name="e54f" id="e54f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                However, for product companies, too often the solution itself
                becomes the “thing” once those insights are captured.
              </p>
              <p name="c4b4" id="c4b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Product thinkers tend to get obsessed about the form factor, the
                specs, the user experience or user interface or the line of copy
                in the app. We get lost in the functional myopia and forget the
                humanity of the problem the product was born to solve. We expect
                our products, which check all the boxes, to be discovered and to
                sell themselves by virtue of their capability.

              <p name="ccfd" id="ccfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                And yet, the story behind the product is just as if not more
                important than the product itself.

                So what does this have to do with commercials and the Light

                Well, first, consider that the Light Phone 2 has already drummed
                up more attention (and $1MM USD in pre-orders more) than any
                other dumb phone on the market to date — and it’s not even on

                Is the Light Phone 2 the best phone on the market? Absolutely
                not. Will it be easy to fix once broken? Definitely not. Will
                the company behind it even exist in 10 years? Probably not.

                But what the team behind the Light Phone 2 has done so well is
                connect what it’s building to the story it wants to tell, and
                the impact of that story-telling on its success is clear.

                In many ways, it’s hard to separate the story from the product:
                they were designed together, and that’s what makes the entire
                offering so appealing — and effective.

                The Takeaway
              </h4>
              <p name="a967" id="a967" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
                I think that notion—that a product should have a story and that
                its story should be inseperable from itself—is one we should as
                product developers take note of.
              </p>
              <p name="6142" id="6142" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                We should know what story our product is trying to tell before
                we even build it, because it is the story that will ultimately
                drive adoption of the products we build, not just the features
                themselves.
              </p>
              <p name="7d8e" id="7d8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                In many ways, the arc of a story ties very neatly into our lean
                canvases and our value proposition designs. Why then do so few
                of us take the time to plan for that story from day one?
              </p>
              <p name="b594" id="b594" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                We as product folk should take more pride in those stories. We
                should be working with our go-to-market teams way before we
                build a thing; we should be aligning on the story we want to
                tell and then working to deliver on that story, not building a
                feature and then trying to wrap a story around it.

                Prioritization is easier. You can prioritize based on the impact
                the feature has on your ability to tell your story.

                Validation is easier. You can get the market to validate what

              <p name="333f" id="333f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
                Your product should be able to tell a great story about why it
                exists, and you should know what that story is going to be
                before you build the product.

                So, the next time you’re looking at a new feature or product,
                start with the story. Just be sure it’s an inspiring one,
                because if it isn’t, you’re unlikely to inspire anyone else—not
                your investors, nor your teams, nor, most crucially, your
                buyers.
