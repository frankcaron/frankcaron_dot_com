                We had a great chat about tech and leadership, but in its wake,

                Yes, this is off-brand and potentially a bit corny. However,
                this momentary respite from my usual writing is my honest

                please bear with me.

                Nearly as old as the commercial internet itself, Ars Technica is
                a tech news institution. Its success can be attributed entirely
                to the contributions of

                and the vision of its editor-in-chief Ken Fisher, who, alongside
                co-founder Jon Stokes, built a resilient media business which
                flourished as its aging competitors faltered.

                Thanks to its coverage of topics like tech law &amp; politics,
                as well as its incredible long-form content, Ars provided its
                niche enthusiast audience with content they would pay to pore
                over for days rather than pandering to a mainstream readership
                who would freely gloss it over in seconds.

                Ars prioritized long-form value over ads, and, in doing so,
                paved the way for modern web media — a strategy that contributed
                to the company’s acquisition by Wired parent Condé Nast in 2008.

                Seeing the rise of the internet and aware that his company may
                be in peril if it couldn’t adapt to the trends, Howard entrusted
                a young group of digital dreamers to transform his physical
                product company into a video game company.

                I had the good fortune to spend some time talking to Aha! CEO
                and co-founder Brian de Haaff recently, and in our short
                conversation, I learned that it’s incredibly important to hire
                with your gut, even when that means saying no to someone that on
                paper should be a perfect match.
              </p>
              <p name="d140" id="d140" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                In building Aha!, Brian has bootstrapped an incredible (and
                under-the-radar) growth company without falling for any of the
                major trappings of today’s modern rickety Valley rocket ships.

              <p name="1264" id="1264" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                He’s accomplished this largely by being exceedingly careful with
                who he and his teams hire, and as a result, he’s enjoyed
                virtually no major employee turnover and his company shows no
                signs of slowing down as Aha! continues to transform product
                enterprises.

                While I only met Daniel Debow once, when he was the CEO of

                have stayed with me to this day.

              <p name="7dbe" id="7dbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Daniel paid very close attention to the competitive market and
                understood better than anyone the landscape he found himself at
                war upon.

              <p name="049f" id="049f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                That’s how we met. In his market monitoring, he’d found a
                critical article I’d written about Rypple’s product while I was
                working on gamification features for Achievers’ platform.
              </p>
              <p name="3dcf" id="3dcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                He was acutely aware of the landscape and where the various
                players in our employee recognition space fit, and he spoke
                confidently about his direction relative to ours when he took
                for a coffee to confront me over what I’d written.

              <p name="dd3e" id="dd3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                His commentary proved prophetic, and as a result of his
                market-mindedness and networking savvy, he was able to create
                the circumstances for the strategic (and timely) acquisition of
                Rypple by SalesForce in 2012.
