                For everyone else, here’s the gist.
              </p>
              <p name="d668" id="d668" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Not that long ago, software projects were predominantly managed
                like complex construction projects.
              </p>

                The basic manifest for the project would be established, and bit
                by bit a complete plan would be built: architecture, blueprints,
                timelines, budgets, contractors, sub-contractors, and, finally,
                the beautiful
                <a

              <p name="87d6" id="87d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The Gantt chart in every way epitomizes this type of build-out:
                it depicts sequential, descending blocks of dependencies across
                a timeline which represents each of the major phases, and
                contributors, of the project.
              </p>
              <p name="8b47" id="8b47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                As a critical artifact of the project, the Gantt chart’s flowing
                top-to-bottom cascade is the suitable visualization of the
                project management style aptly named “waterfall”.
              </p>
              <p name="2462" id="2462" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Yet, building buildings is hard and takes a long time. That’s
                largely because missteps in the project can be incredibly
                dangerous, not just to financers but to human lives, as well.
              </p>
              <p name="aecb" id="aecb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                With that in mind, waterfall in the context of construction
                makes a lot of sense: its command and control model, with the
                big design up front, saves not just time but money and
                potentially lives.

                But an app is not a building, and managing software projects
                with that approach often instead results in other big
                problems — namely, launching a product into a market that has
                moved onto another app in the two years it took you to build it.

                Avoiding this outcome was the goal of the alternate and more
                oft-referenced project management approaches of “agile” and
                “lean”. These methods focus on moving quickly, designing
                on-the-fly, and applying the scientific method to guess, test,
                and learn fast.

                A story is quite often the primary “blueprint” of agile
                development. It is meant to be a concise written summary of a
                specific user, a specific job to be done, and a specific set of
                acceptance criteria which encapsulate what the user must be able
                to accomplish with the software.

                Sometimes, stories include mock-ups of a workflow. Sometimes,
                stories include technical details or test cases or edge
                scenarios. Sometimes, they may even include other details, like
                how a user will hear out about the new capability or how much
                money it will make the company building it.

                Whereas the story first began life rooted in telling a simple

                meant to be: a fully fleshed-out, detailed, bulletproofed,
                exacting specification.

                With this shift in the spirit of a story, our “agile” and “lean”

                speed to market.

                We seem to no longer apply the most fundamental principle of
                scientific theory: experimentation with raw materials, in the

                into thinking mock-ups and prototypes in closed environments are
                accurate indicators of performance in the real world.

                Rather, we argue about the design patterns of tables and lists.

                One of the truly amazing advantages that software enjoys over
                other types of products is one we seem to so seldom use to its
                fullest: the ability to split-test after we ship.

                We have this incredible power given to us by technology: we can
                with but a modicum of engineering effort show a part our product
                to only a small fraction of our customer base.

                We can experiment with raw materials, with real customers and
                real data. And yes, our changes may wind up being the vinegar to
                our customer’s baking soda; they may spill out of our beakers
                and make a mess on the floor.

                But for those of us not designing MRI machines and guns, we

                We should be spending less time writing design specs and

                Stories are a great tool for quickly encapsulating a user need
                and a job to be done, but they shouldn’t become exhaustive
