                It is not uncommon for boys, earlier in their life, to look at
                the man who bore them as a tyrant, a dictator, and, for some of
                us, an enemy. It is, likewise, not uncommon for boys, later in
                their life, to find the good in their fathers and hold it dear.
              </p>
              <p name="8759" id="8759" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I suppose then that it’s no surprise I’m about to do just that.
              </p>
              <p name="dd61" id="dd61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                My father is a man bound by usefulness. His self worth is
                directly proportional to how much he can do for you. He and my
                mother share that trait. Maybe everyone does after a certain
                age.
              </p>
              <p name="b5dc" id="b5dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Nevertheless, in that line of duty, my father derided his boys
                at every turn. My brother and I were made to feel useless at the
                expense of our father’s need to feel useful. “You guys will just
                mess it up,” the echoes of the past ring. “Let me warm up the
                car. Let me fix that. Let me do it.”
              </p>
              <p name="70a4" id="70a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                As a result of this tutelage, or lack there of, our entire lives
                have been defined by the pursuit of a similar purpose — a
                pursuit which, for both of us, has been characterized by the
                need to help people.
              </p>
              <p name="9ba0" id="9ba0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The irony of my father’s “teachings” was that we would develop
                the same behaviour, born by a need to be useful, due to a
                birthright of fostered uselessness.
              </p>
              <p name="f161" id="f161" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Of course, it was his attitude which, in my youth, made my
                father my enemy. And, likely, it was my resulting,
                unknowingly-imitative attitude that made me my brother’s enemy.
              </p>
              <p name="c953" id="c953" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                So, in pursuit of usefulness, my brother and I went separate
                ways, both in opposing trajectories towards different gaps in my
                father’s domains.
              </p>
              <p name="e190" id="e190" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                My brother sought to close my father’s academic gap and to help,
                as our father rarely did, others learn. He’s a teacher, a
                studied one, and he has both the artistic, linguistic, and
                literary acumen and context which my father and I lack.
              </p>
              <p name="6178" id="6178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I opted for the trades of business and technology, the
                confluence of which has become my home: product management—a
                home wherein I find my value in helping others add value
                efficiently and effectively. I closed the business and tech gap
                of my father and brother.
              </p>
              <p name="cda7" id="cda7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                And yet, for our pursuits, my brother and I end up remarkably as
                our father has.

              <p name="03dc" id="03dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I have built my career on running around trying to do things for
                others. Find a little hacky code-shop work-around to enable a
                stakeholder without dev. Get this favour from one stakeholder to
                buy us time to build a better product for another. Convince
                leadership to give us time to buy air cover for tech debt to
                curry dev favour.

                I’m the handyman of software development. But I’m not the
                architect. I’m not the electrician, nor the plumber, nor the
                foreman, nor the financer. I am a band-aid covering a healing
                wound growing resilient to future tears and tears, as my father
                was.

                And so, I fear for my father a future I envision for myself
                which my father faces before me but not for me: retirement;
                irrelevance.

                My father, after 40+ years of working and nearly 30 in a single
                employ, has finally retired—that, the escarpment before him. He
                spent this lifetime working for

                For a man who spent his life in manual labour, “Pa” has had
                gilded career full of hard-working nights and celebrity-tipping
                days. His luck in landing at the private airport afforded him
                years of celebrity meetings which he cherished and looked on
                fondly.

                He will speak fonder still of being tipped by Mario Lemieux and
                Wayne Gretzky. And yet, fonder still will he speak of unloading

                And my father was lauded in his work by his peers. He was the
