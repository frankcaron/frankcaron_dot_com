                In 2016, after five years of working in technical Product
                Management, I made a decision about my career. I was going to

                I had some strong beliefs in my youth, but chief among them was
                the belief that selling software is harder than building

                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">time x difficulty</em>,
                build was trending downward towards “easy”, while sell upward
                towards “difficult”. Software dev was commoditizing. I wanted to
                be on the right side of history.

                Along the way, though, I made a specific execution decision
                based on some advice I received early on: “to be a great product
                marketer, you need to be a great salesperson.”

                But while I loved helping the sales teams I was supporting
                throughout my career, the thought of joining them filled me with
                a tremendous amount of reticence — and a pinch of disgust.

                I was not a salesperson. I’m not a “hustler”. I’m not into snake

                pen. I just want to get shit done and I want to know the
                technical nitty gritty and I want the customer solutions to work

                In working my way up through the corporate ranks in the big

                For those unfamiliar, companies with larger and more complex
                product portfolios—not necessarily just software—often employ

                complex needs to the specific products and services that the

                Sometimes this can be considered “consulting”, but in a

                product marketer if not the product manager? Am I doing the
                exact same job I was doing as a PM and a PMM, only with product

                I stayed the course, though, until one day, while watching a
                Drift webinar, the following Venn Digram flashed on the screen:

                I quit the webinar immediately. Drift was dead wrong, I thought,
                and the next and perhaps final phase of my career was, in that
                moment, solidified.

                The intersection of product, marketing, sales, and customer
                success is not product marketing: it’s pre-sales.

                Product Marketing and Pre-Sales are stunningly similar — the
                former is simply more concerned with casting a broader,
                generalized narrative outward while the latter focuses on honing
                the narrative inward toward the specific language and nuances
                and concrete details of a given customer.

                Pipe gen, campaign execution, positioning, messaging,
                enablement, GTM — all of these things are equally relevant and
                equally in the purview and control of both roles. Yet, the
                ability to deliver immediacy and relevancy to a customer, along
                with the direct control of the message and lack of political and
                organizational friction necessary to deliver it, is not possible
                as a PMM.

                The best top, middle, and bottom funnel resources are those with
                insights, stories, and details generated by pre-sales. The best
                customer stories are born from strong pre-sales engagement
                before, and after, the sale. The best enablement? Run by
                pre-sales. The best voice of customer feedback and compete intel
                to guide the roadmap? The key data and insights needed to
                influence and push the GM to act? Take a guess.

                The Third Epoch

              <p name="6290" id="6290" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
                I began my career as a software developer. Though I had longed
                to be a writer, and I did spend much time as a technical writer
                early on, I spent my early years fixated on the build side, on
                the product: I was obsessed with
                <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"
                  ><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the thing</em></strong

                As I developed in my career, I became passionate about
                <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"
                  ><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the problem</em></strong
                ><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">. </em>That led to the
                transition into product management, to help orient the build
                towards a real problem that was valuable to solve, and later
                product marketing, to help communicate the problem’s
                value-driving solution to the market.
              </p>
              <p name="fd65" id="fd65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Now, as I approach almost twenty years in the software industry,
                I find myself focused on
                <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"
                  ><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the person</em></strong
                >. Who needs help and what do they need to get the job done? How
                can I use the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">things</em> we
                have to solve the
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">problem</em> they have? And
                how can I communicate to them clearly, in and on their terms?

                To me, the evolution seems natural, and while I will never fully
                abandon the build and the funnel and the tech and the process
                necessary to make the business I work for hum, it is the
                customer and the cure for their immediate and long-term ills
                that has me hyped to embrace this third epoch.
