                Here’s a surprisingly and seemingly difficult question to
                answer, particularly in Toronto: who ultimately owns “product

                In my experience (at least as far as Toronto is concerned), most
                start-ups do a horrible job at assigning and empowering a single
                point of accountability for product P&amp;L—and their products
                suffer for it.

                Recently, as the city’s start-ups have become scale-ups and

                chamber), the General Manager role is emerging as one answer to
                that question, particularly as prominent international companies

                Success on the top-line during the start-up phase is pretty
                simple: work as fast as possible to get to a greater
                product-driven revenue than the burn on dev investment into
                obtaining that product-driven revenue. This is in many ways very
                similar to the common metric of “<a

                As stated, though, this is necessarily product-specific measure
                and is also necessarily imperfect. Product revenue will be
                driven by more than just the product, obviously: both sales and
                marketing will significantly contribute to that number.

                After product-market fit is found and the start-up becomes a
                scale-up, product revenue affected by sales and marketing will
                be more often than not incremental rather than exponential. It
                is product development’s job to find the exponential gains and
                affect product profitability in multiples.

                The same is true for the unit profitability. Adding more
                valuable customers by having sales sell longer commitments will
                multiply unit product profitability, but that has its limits and
                eventually only product development can affect unit
                profitability in multiples.

                The right answer
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">should be </em>the product
                manager. A VP will own the product P&amp;L of the full
                portfolio, a Director will own product P&amp;L of a given
                segment or logically-seperated part of the portfolio, and an
                individual PM will own product P&amp;L of a given product or
                part of a product.

                A good product manager, in my opinion, is one who can steward a

                Here’s the problem with that belief, though: taking that
                absolute accountability stance necessitates giving absolute
                control. No one will agree to own a metric as sensitive as
                profitability unless they can be empowered to make decisions,
                plan the strategy, and execute.

              <p name="2536" id="2536" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                And therein lies the rub, at least based on my experience in
                Toronto: product managers are rarely given control and more
                rarely own product P&amp;L.

                For the most part, a good product manager in Toronto is one who
                can work well with dev, talk to sales, schmooze with execs, and
                ship on time. Nothing more. And somehow, that warrants $120,000+
                a year or more in salary.

                Rather than taking smart people, giving them a huge salary, and
                sticking them in a chair to take orders from stakeholders, I
                have been mulling a move towards a model wherein a Product
                Manager is incented to more immediately (and necessarily) share
                in the profit but is required to more actively and literally
                “manage” the product as a business.
              </p>
              <p name="6af6" id="6af6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Critical to this plan, though, is the complimentary “give” to
                that take: we need to empower PMs to have the autonomy (read:
                exec buy in) to steward the product towards profitability based
                on their “boots-on-the-ground” view of the battlefield.

                profitability by 5%. At the end of the quarter, she is awarded a

                Assuming MRR stays flat, the incremental benefit of her work has

                her bonus has a payback period of just 5 months, even though the
                value of her work will begin to generate ongoing net profit 5

                The majority would be immediately paid a ton less and would
                suddenly be so much more concretely measured and pressured. Many
                would wash out (myself included, most likely), as increasing
                product profitability is really hard and only gets harder over
                time.
              </p>
              <p name="7d2f" id="7d2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Many of today’s tech companies would be unable to accommodate
                such a model, too. The Product Manager would need to have
                significantly more control over (or rather alignment with) Dev,
                as any misalignment between the two parties would set the PM up
                to fail.
              </p>
              <p name="a4b9" id="a4b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                (N.B., A real-world analog here would be Sales Managers whose
                comp is a function of their team members’ performance and comp.)

              <p name="ded7" id="ded7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                A lot of execs would likely reject the model, too. Giving any
                one employee who isn’t heavily vested complete control is risky
                in even the most ego-free start-up environments, let alone those
                wherein the senior leadership need to feel the heroes and
                #mansplain how business is done to all subordinates in sight.

                To be fair, a few companies in Toronto use bonus programs and
                quarterly goals to attempt to achieve similar results, though
                I’ve yet to see this effectively implemented for product
                managers in my experience as an individual contributor PM.

                The Takeaway
              </h3>
              <p name="364f" id="364f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                Admittedly, as I’ve worked through the process of learning how
                to manage product managers, I’ve struggled to create the
                environment for my team that I feel I’ve been deprived as I grew
                up a PM. I suppose that’s very paternal.
              </p>
              <p name="28be" id="28be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                One of the reasons I’ve grown so fatigued of the PM role in my
                own career as I’ve aged is that the role, generally, meanders
                between the business and the build-out in a manner that often
                necessitates the relegation of the role’s actor to a position
                subordinate to the loudest voice in the org — perhaps a
                heavy-handed “product” CEO who isn’t ready to let go, or a
                domineering sales team more concerned about this quarter than
                the next, or even (as a best-worse-case) a vocal minority of old
                customers who the business is too scared to evolve beyond.

              <p name="8be2" id="8be2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Transforming the comp model, and indeed the focus of the role,
                toward something more concrete and directly tied to a business
                metric that can be objectively measured and managed, feels like
                the salve for my team to the pains I’ve suffered before them. It
                feels like the trojan horse to create a world in which PMs
                aren’t just project managers or “tech translators” or “idea”
                people. It’s not perfect, admittedly, but it’s a move from
                current state to better state.
