                Of course, I’m being a bit facetious, but I do think you need
                more than just a broad vision and a clear mission to scale. For
                a lot of scaling start-ups, coming up with a clear vision and
                turning that into an actionable mission is actually super
                fucking hard. Sometimes it takes years. Sometimes it takes an
                entirely different leader. Rarely, sometimes it doesn’t.

                But regardless of where the start-up is at with its vision and
                mission, I think there’s a ton to be gained by doing something
                far, far simpler that any leader or leadership can do right now.

                Whether it’s aspiring to have a better company culture, better
                processes, or just plain better execution in general,
                broadcasting out an “idol” as a company can be a huge boon to
                the productivity of your teams and your leadership’s ability to
                make focused decisions that keep the company moving towards that
                bigger, brighter future painted.

                Don’t just tell your team you know better and you do better than
                the rest of the world. Be humble and show them what better looks
                like.
