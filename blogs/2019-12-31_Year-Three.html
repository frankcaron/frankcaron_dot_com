                A year has passed, and as the internet would be quickly to call
                out, so too has a decade. And as my FOMO shifts from Facebook
                Event pictures and Instagram Stories to self-serving LinkedIn
                “thought leadership” posts, I would be remiss if I didn’t have

                in pursuit of growth that I felt the role I’d stumbled into
                couldn’t offer, I spent the majority of this year translating
                everything I’d learned as a developer and technical product
                manager into the radically different role of solution
                engineering.

                As I am so wont to do, I had found many ways to rationalize my

                the intent of accelerating my time to effectiveness.

                Had you asked me in April or May of 2019 what I felt the SE role
                was, I would’ve said “it’s like being a customer’s product
                manager, where all of the conceivable product solutions are
                already built so you don’t need devs”.

                The act of discovery, where we as consultants strategically
                engage with customers early in the sales process to better
                understand their businesses and business challenges and
                effectively map them to our sold solutions, is in no significant
                way different than the equivalent exercise for problem
                identification in the product realm.

                And the novelty of each engagement, each new business and new
                set of stakeholders and new situations, is intoxicating. It
                provides the kind of constant newness that consistently
                captivates my natural yet smartphone-exacerbated nanosecond

                radically different ways of working, my perspective has swung
                wildly towards realizing that I was concerned about the right

                language. That skill was valued for a spell. I, and the broader

                commoditized — particularly as the internet has consolidated and

                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">knowledge</em> and Google
                has made it instantly accessible and searchable while, in
                paralell, the proliferation of open-source software and instant

                made accessing the

                But we do so with a touch mom’s intellect and a lot of dad’s
                laziness, which meant we were “fortunate” for more outcome with
                less effort. Yet we carried still the same begrudging “there’s
                no other way to survive as an artist” latent belief.

                And as a result, we struggle as grumpy old men generally happy
                with nothing traditionally associated with happiness yet well
                aware that what we love doing isn’t profitable so we have to do
                other shit. Too pragmatic to actually pursue the things that
                could and would make us rich and happier if we surrendered to
                the risk and took it.

                In facing that story, and the fuzzy truthiness of it, we were
                left to face the reality of our own decisions. And that was a
                turning point of the year.

                Becoming aware and humble about how our parents’ lives unfolded
                and how they approached the world would’ve been impossible
                without doing the work to step back from ourselves and the fog
                of our conscious, day-to-day minds in order to understand where
                we come from and why we do the things we do and think the things
                we think. And that awareness, and empathy, gives us the power to
                change.

                It seems trite in writing, but I cannot understate the power and
                freedom that comes with opening oneself up to understand the
                deep why behind the actions, thoughts, and words. That kind of
                analysis is essential to deeply understanding, and improving,
                oneself and is as well valuable to doing the same with others.

                In fact, it is in reflecting on that narrative that the relative
                lack of change from this year is rooted, I’ve recognized,
                finally, internally what so many have been telling me for so
                long: changing the external environment won’t fix the internal
                behaviors and problems that hold us back from true contentment.

                Suffice to say, the realization was game-changing and that this
                is a side effect from my new work pursuit is fascinating. I look
                forward to investing further into myself and my awareness in
                2020 and the decade beyond.

                So, in spite of my consternation around the truism of “change is
                constant”, I can’t help but feel the suddenly-contented customer
                of its currency.

                Sure, the change of this year past has been largely beneath the
                water’s surface, a flurry of kicking legs shifting the water
                beneath the calm visage of the swan floating above.

                2019, and really the entire decade, took me towards this next
                decade a happier and healthier human being and human doing. I
                think I’ve finally found a path to contentment, and all it took
                was a little change — of mindset and awareness instead of
                literally everything else, as I’d been doing throughout the
                decade past.

                How else, then, could I end this year and this decade as I am?
                Humbled by the journey and hoping it continues just a little bit
                longer — for all of us.
