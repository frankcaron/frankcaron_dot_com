                Mid last year, I was in the process of researching and
                specifying a massive solution with a team of product managers,
                and in that process, I came to question and ultimately throw
                away the notion of “MVP”, or “minimum viable product”, in favour
                of something a little different.

                Why Not MVP?
              </h3>
              <p name="0bc6" id="0bc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                In start-ups, the

                  >MVP as a North Star</a
                >
                is a great and functional concept. When the requirements are
                fairly modest and there’s a ton of leniency and agility for
                trial and error, building for the minimum works, and labeling
                your product as an MVP poses no threats.
              </p>
              <p name="4a4a" id="4a4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                However, for bigger solutions to bigger problems with bigger
                stakes and “bigger” stakeholders, I feel the concept doesn&#39;t
                quite capture enough detail to focus conversations during the
                ideation and research phases. It’s not a bright enough light,
                and it doesn&#39;t guide a scaled flock of shepherds. On the
                contrary, the simplicity of the “MVP” notion usually distracts
                more than it helps in this context.
              </p>
              <p name="61ad" id="61ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Thus, in trying to better mentally model what exactly to build
                for a new, massive solution comprised of potentially multiple
                components (products themselves in some cases), I&#39;ve come up
                with something slightly more specific but vastly more
                applicable.

                Forget defining an MVP: instead, define a product that can

                Although perhaps controversial for start-ups, for product folk
                at established companies, the notion that a product won’t make
                money out of the gate is, at least in my experience, a
                non-starter. No one is going to green-light internal investment
                in a product if there isn’t a business and monetization plan
                around it.
              </p>
              <p name="e8af" id="e8af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Ergo, the first important question to answer is “how will your
                product eat”? How will it receive unto it its daily bread, or
                rather, how will it generate and sustain income?
              </p>
              <p name="daca" id="daca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Even for start-ups, this question should be the very next thing
                answered after “what problem can I solve for the market?”,
                regardless of whether or not the answer is largely theoretical.

                The next question to answer is a bit counter-intuitive, because
                you often take for granted its importance. But how will your
                product shit?
              </p>
              <p name="7ecf" id="7ecf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                By shitting, I’m referring to all of the necessary functions of
                your application that aren&#39;t sexy and don’t help it eat,
                fuck, or die directly: accounting and reporting, dev-ops
                infrastructure, compliance (e.g., PCI, SOX, etc.) — all that
                stinky stuff that simply must be done, no matter how gross it
                is.
              </p>
              <p name="5323" id="5323" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                One big mistake, particularly in small to mid-size product
                shops, is ignoring the “shit” work. In a bigger organization,
                though, even a product heartily eating will be on life support
                post-launch if this critical work isn&#39;t done. Worse yet, a
                bad shitter who eats in abundance will be in even more trouble.

              <p name="6ded" id="6ded" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                More often than not, making small design conceits up-front by
                thinking ahead here dramatically reduces the costs and pain of
                doing so thereafter.

                Of course, implicit in the product’s worth should be its ability
                to deliver “satisfaction” to the user and to solve his or her
                problem. I like to call this “fucking”.

                How can the product deliver to the end-user something both
                fundamentally capable and simultaneously desirable? You want
                that wow moment, and you want it to hit the spot time and time
                again — and you also want to have the secret, forthcoming
                “twirl” waiting in the wings to mix it up when the user gets
                bored of that.

                If your product turns out to eat poorly, suffer from
                constipation, or ultimately lacks in mojo, what can you do to
                recoup costs? What kind of insurance can you invest in? Can you
                make it an organ donor by building reusable pieces that help you
                pivot? Are you prepared to perform the surgery necessary to
                bring it back to life?

                Ultimately, building a product that can ESFD out of the gate
                seems like a much more sound goal and a better goalpost — and,
                importantly, one that doesn&#39;t create an argument over what
                “viable” really means.
