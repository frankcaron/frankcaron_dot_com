                Once upon a time, being a product owner was relatively simple.
                Okay, that’s a lie. More accurately, in the days of “boxed
                product”, product ownership was largely about features –
                features which could be easily mapped back to a customer’s
                stories and use cases.
              </p>
              <p name="dc9f" id="dc9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The implementation of said features largely didn’t matter; Mike
                wants to convert a nondescript numeric value into a currency
                value, and as long as the application allows that somehow
                (ideally in a UX-friendly way), Product was happy.
              </p>
              <p name="7abb" id="7abb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                After all, Product concerns itself first and foremost with the
                problems and looks to Engineering to provide solutions, albeit
                with Product ensuring said solutions can adequately address the
                problems in a manner effective for the business at large.
              </p>
              <p name="e82e" id="e82e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The advent of software’s increasing API-ification, though, has
                dramatically blurred the line where business requirements end
                and where implementation begins. When your customer Mike wants
                an end-point to convert a numeric value into a currency value,
                the data he provides and the response he receives are just as
                much business requirements and acceptance criteria as they are
                implementation.

              <p name="9ece" id="9ece" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                So how, then, does one adequately draw the line? Who specs the
                API? Who owns it post-launch? How does it evolve?

              <p name="6f58" id="6f58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">
                I wish I had the clear answer to any of those quandaries, as my
                enterprise day job would be easier for it.

              <p name="7d66" id="7d66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                In start-ups and small companies, this kind of collaboration is
                a breeze, and as such these types of ownership issues are
                usually non-existent. Making this work with one Product Owner
                and one Lead Engineer is as easy as a lunch and a beer.

              <p name="d026" id="d026" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                But in an enterprise company, I can’t begin to feel certain or
                even falsely confident in the correct approach; I’ve encountered
                only issues and no resolutions in my experience thus far.
              </p>
              <p name="b6e8" id="b6e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                In some enterprise circumstances, the line in the sand is clear.
                If your customer isn’t consuming an API as his UX (or, as I
                prefer, “DX”) it probably doesn’t make sense for Product to own
                the API, as it is truly an implementation detail.
              </p>
              <p name="4270" id="4270" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                However, with services leaning more towards integrations and
                service-to-service interactions, particularly in
                service-oriented architectures, this is increasingly rare.
              </p>
              <p name="214d" id="214d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                A “GET”, then, is as essential to the ability of a given product
                to satisfy business requirements as is the need for a specific
                set of UX interactions which enforce a workflow.

              <p name="b2ec" id="b2ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Unfortunately, this makes translating requirements into stories
                difficult, as writing the right API requires fully understanding
                the interactions between services, or rather, the passage and
                manipulation of data and the application of business logic. In
                other words, writing a good API requires understanding a great
                many “implementation details”.

                By necessity, it follows that Product starts to dabble in
                architecture and Engineering starts to dabble in stories and
                acceptance criteria – a situation neither party is comfortable
                with, at least in my experience.

                Invariably, Product, who isn’t as technically adept and isn’t
                privy to all the technology discussions, messes up its API
                design or makes short-sighted implementation decisions.
                Meanwhile, Engineering, having not talked directly to the
                customer or lacking visibility to the long-term business
                strategy and product roadmap, fails to meet critical business
                requirements and acceptance criteria.

                Neither team has all the information it needs to do the
                end-to-end job, and, because of the overlapping responsibilities
                and ultimate contractual artifact in the API, being pivotal to
                writing the stories and predicated on a concrete architecture,
                work is stymied by murky owners and unclear action items.

                In this case, I believe the answer is clear: both Product and

                There cannot be a delineation because the requirements imply
                certain aspects of implementation. It’s pretty clear.

                Upon Reflection Years Later
              </h3>
              <p name="fae2" id="fae2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                In the years since I’d originally published this article, I’ve
                begun to believe more firmly in a singular stance: a technical
                product manager should own the API spec.
              </p>
              <p name="fa0b" id="fa0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Part of the value of a product manager is in being passionately
                dispassionate about the product and the solution. Just as
                customers are often too close to the problem to be able to
                articulate what they need in place of what they say they want,
                so too can be developers.
              </p>
              <p name="ade9" id="ade9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                By taking the ownership for defining the actual interface for
                integration, technical product managers are forced to truly
                understand, and internalize, the developer use case that they
                are trying to facilitate while being a degree of separation away
                from the technology itself.
              </p>
              <p name="a61b" id="a61b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Without any implicit bias or preference for a specific solution,
                then, the technical product manager, who is one degree removed
                from the consumption of the API, is able to make a more
                dispassionate recommendation by aggregating feedback from the
                customer developer as opposed to imbuing preferences or biases
                from the internal developer.
              </p>
              <p name="6a51" id="6a51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The same principle applies to user experience design. A UX
                designer of a restaurant POS, for example, may not be a
                restaurant server, but the process of research, design, testing,
                and iteration ensures that she can represent the requirements
                dispassionately and intelligently.

              <p name="5ce2" id="5ce2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Providing the technical product manager is able to properly
                canvas the customer developer directly or customer developer
