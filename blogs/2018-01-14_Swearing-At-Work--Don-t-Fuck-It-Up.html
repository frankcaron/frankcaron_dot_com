                Admittedly, the line, delivered ham in fist, is but one of the
                many moments of Spielberg’s assured Oscar nominee so
                transparently designed to bludgeon audiences and critics alike

                Believe it or not, I do think there’s a lesson to learn here
                that we can apply to the way we write about our products and
                services.

                Swear words are amongst the most powerful in our lexicon. Very
                few words can more succinctly capture emotion in a human,
                relatable way.

                In fact, this is something I believe in very strongly, and I
                regularly use swear words in presentations and in my writing.

                captures very, very quickly the value prop of its product while
                injecting an effective humanized humour into its pitch.

                But like all powerful things, swear words can be very dangerous
                when used inappropriately. The same stickiness that makes them
                useful can also make them deadly.

                Just as very few will ever forget Trump’s message here, because
                it is captured by a single word that rouses our attention, so
                too will those that come across your product if you use
                incendiary language improperly.

                So, you can use a word like “shithole” when you need to and be
                successful in doing so. You may just want to avoid using it to
                describe your competitors or their countries…
