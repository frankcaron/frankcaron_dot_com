                At a moment’s notice during the summer of 2013, I fled a

                As a young kid who attended the University of Waterloo for
                Computer Science, I was from Frosh Week forward conditioned to
                believe that the clearest marker for success was making it down
                to, and in, the Valley.
              </p>
              <p name="c593" id="c593" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                That conditioning heavily coloured the early part of my career.
                From the moment I began working professionally, I measured the
                success of my employers by their alignment to the Valley’s
                ideals.

              <p name="934a" id="934a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I became obsessed with the Valley’s titanic tech culture, its
                VCs, and its heroic figures and founders. I became a fervent fan
                of a new type of player and a different type of hockey sticks. I
                envied friends who’d made the move and envied further the
                fortunes that followed them.

                But above all, I longed desperately for the sticker-clad

                Union Square first edition smartphone,

                badge with the neat tongue-in-cheek buttons etched with JSON

                But as with anything you put on a pedestal, its reality was far
                less fulfilling than its fantasy, and in spite of ample

                its people, and its purpose are not for me.

                If you want to really profit from your small business, there is
                an upper bound on what is possible by yourself.

                Unless you can automate large swaths of your job, or the service
                you provide is reliant on infrastructure that you’re largely
                just reselling for a profit (e.g., web hosting), a freelance
                service-based business isn’t scalable without hiring staff.

                There really are no great solutions out there to solve this
                problem, either; trust me, I looked.

                I see the business development portion of the job as a large
                untapped market for some SMB software company out there. If I
                could eliminate or at least subsidize the cost of acquisition
                from a time investment perspective, then I could theoretically
                continue to flourish in this freelance business.

                Given my skillset, though, if I’m going to run a business, I’d
                rather run a software business — the margins are way better, for
                starters, and there’s far more opportunity to scale.

                isn’t for me.

                I can already hear two groups of voices shouting opinions at me
                through the screen: the “I Told You So’s” and the “You Don’t Do
                It For The Money, You Do It For The Lifestyle’rs”.

                Ultimately, this experiment, like my trip to San Francisco, was
                necessary for me. I had to feel it for myself.

                I had to wake up at 3 a.m. excited to work on a writing project
                and I had to stare in the face the ugly facts at month-end that
                my time was simply not being profitably spent.

              <p name="d901" id="d901" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I did both, and what I realized in the process is that while I
                love writing, I have an aptitude for product and for business
                that like all-too-many things I only came to appreciate after it
                was cast aside.

                Perhaps I have succumbed to a sort of Stockholm syndrome of
                sorts to product management and product marketing after so many
                years of being their captive meal after meal. And perhaps not.

                Either way, I will always love writing and will always reflect
                warmly on the days past when it consumed more of my time, but
                service-based freelance just isn’t a productive way forward for
                me. So end my plans to go full freelance and my time working
                with FreshBooks.

                Freelancing is far more about running a business than it is
                about doing something you love —and that becomes clear if you do
                the math as I have above for yourself.

                If you have the aptitude and appetite to run a business, you
                should be starting it with the express intent to build a
                business (and not a labour of love). And if you do, it’s in your
                best interest to plan to replace yourself as soon as reasonably
                possible. Otherwise, you risk doing what you love for yourself
                at a greater personal cost than you could do what you love for
                another company.

                Over the last year, I’ve learned for myself that I’m not

                Can you profit from doing so? Absolutely, if you enjoy managing
                writers and you have the network to back up your machinations to
                do so. However, no amount of passion will make your effort
                profitable lest you can scale it beyond yourself, and at that
                point, you’re not doing what you love anymore — you’re running a
                business staffed with other people doing what you love.

                For me, if I’m to spend my days managing a business, my efforts
