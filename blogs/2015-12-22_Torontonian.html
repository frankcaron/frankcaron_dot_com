                The winter in Toronto had been colder than usual this year, and
                that left him even more beaten and bruised than had the winters
                of years past.

                For all of the climate change he’d been reading about in the
                free Metro papers he’d found strewn about here or there, it sure
                didn’t seem like things were getting any warmer, he thought to
                himself ignorantly.

                Unsuccessful in finding sustenance in the first of the city’s
                branded black garbage bins he’d come across, he continued west
                down D’arcy Street towards Huron, darting from house to house.
              </p>
              <p name="8ca9" id="8ca9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The roadway beside him, lit by the grey sky above, was full of
                riveted snow forming tracks for the tires that crumbled along
                now and then. Straddling the tracks were the sidewalks he
                trafficked, painted with a whisked white chalk-like veneer of
                ice and snow which felt as cold and unwelcoming underfoot as did
                the uncomfortable glances of passers-by who, warm and safe
                within their cars, passed by just slow enough for him to catch
                them gawking.
              </p>
              <p name="a2b3" id="a2b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                He was used to it. No one wanted him in the city; he was a
                scourge, crawling around the city in search of survival having
                been pushed out of his home and into a life not of his own
                doing. And so he lived, garbage bin to garbage bin, staying out
                of sight in the day and alternating between sleeping and
                scavenging in the night. Homeless. Helpless.
              </p>
              <p name="9be9" id="9be9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                It wasn’t a glamorous existence, and, in spite of the hardship
                he’d endured, he was vilified for just trying to survive. How
                difficult a thought, that. And yet, he was incapable of finding
                anywhere else to go; he hadn’t the means and could do little
                else but attempt to survive until he could no longer.
              </p>
              <p name="bf61" id="bf61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                A few more garbage bins went searched unsuccessfully before he
                finally managed to find one, unsecured, with a few morsels that
                would hold him for the night. The sight of the scraps sent him
                into a frenzy, and his tattered coat grew ever-dirtier as he
                viciously excavated his hard-won prize from what you’d thrown
                away.
              </p>
              <p name="0fcf" id="0fcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Without a second thought, he slammed the garbage into his face,
                sucking it down in between exasperated breaths, each a visible
                cloud of hot air and stink.
              </p>
              <p name="11b6" id="11b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Content for the moment with his work, he turned away from the
                garbage and continued north on Huron to an alley a few legs up.
                The alleys were generally a good place to hide, as they, lesser
                travelled, left him without much in the way of disturbance.

                The cold day ultimately gave way to a colder night. Chinatown’s
                morning grey had turned to a sickly orange of artificially-lit
                night. A single loading bay lamp set the the row of garages and
                garbage cans alight, leaving plenty of crevices where one could
                stay out of sight.
              </p>
              <p name="00a6" id="00a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Sam did his best to huddle up in a corner between a brick garage
                and a chain link fence. Not much of a bed, he’d be the first to
                admit, but it kept him away from the main thoroughfare and
                somewhat sheltered from the wind.
              </p>
              <p name="81d3" id="81d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                But the wind grew ever fiercer. With each howl it seemed to echo
                the shouts of those who’d cast him out were he to be found. He
                was used to it, and his hide had developed an
                increasingly-disgusting set of wrinkled, rippled, calloused
                blisters.
              </p>
              <p name="a55a" id="a55a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Unfortunately, his solace was short-lived. Just as he was dozing
                off did he find his ears perked alert with the
                increasingly-audible sounds of someone’s approach.
              </p>
              <p name="1eaf" id="1eaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                A black, shapeless blob appeared in the distance, blotting out
                more and more of the laneway’s end street lamp as it drew closer
                and larger. It wasn’t long before the blob took shape as man
                holding a garbage bag.
              </p>
              <p name="2bb1" id="2bb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Sam scrunched his back up against the brick garage, pushing
                himself closer to the fence in the hopes that he might stay
                undiscovered. He felt himself grating against the fence, cold
                and sharp. As he did, he heard the crunch of snow compacting as
                the man drew closer.
              </p>
              <p name="a72b" id="a72b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                With each step, the crunch grew louder. With each crunch, Sam’s
                back drew stiffer. Closer, and closer still, did the man blob
                draw, until he was mere steps away.
              </p>
              <p name="d12d" id="d12d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Sam held his breath. He prayed. He heard the man open the lid of
                a garbage can just steps away, and then drop his bag into it
                with a thud of heavy waste and a clink of bottles. The lid
                closed moments later before a chorus of crunches; and then,
                silence.
              </p>
              <p name="60a9" id="60a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Sam froze in fear in the deafening silence. Seconds passed as
                hours. Sam’s heart raced. Beads of sweat formed on his brow. He
                held himself tight to the corner. Eyes closed. Fingers crossed.
                Please, don’t find me. Don’t find me, he pleaded. Is he still
                there? Where is he? His mind raced.
              </p>
              <p name="6b73" id="6b73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">

                “FUCK!”, the man yelled as he turned, startled, to find Sam.

              <p name="a44e" id="a44e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Sam had only a moment to open his frozen, fearful eyes to behold
                the man who, mouth agape, let loose a fury of screams.
              </p>

              <p name="9221" id="9221" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The man leaned forward into his yells, projecting his voice
                along with his spit directly into Sam, who remained frozen. It
                wasn’t until the man acted that Sam fled.
              </p>
              <p name="9ccc" id="9ccc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                With great fury and anger, the man swung his boot and connected
                with Sam right in the gut. Sam screamed a high-pitch wail in
                anguish as he felt his stomach draw immediately warm and then
                instantly ablaze as his beaten body took another blow.
              </p>
              <p name="5776" id="5776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Sam coughed a single splurt of bright, crimson blood onto the
                bleach white snow beneath before he managed to stumble away,
                hearing behind him the cacophony of curses still flowing from
                the man.
              </p>
              <p name="64b4" id="64b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                It was in a haze of confusion and pain that Sam stumbled out of
                Chinatown and towards the intersection of College and
                University. He could barely see, eyes glassy from the pain. He
                continued to stumble on, though, in hopes of solace.
              </p>
              <p name="32ed" id="32ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                His blindness did not subside as he stumbled towards the
                intersection. At least the pain had left him warm and distracted
                enough to no longer feel the cold. In fact, were it not for the
                pain in his gut, he would’ve felt somewhat relieved — so much so
                that he didn’t even react when he felt a slam knock him to the
                ground.
              </p>
              <p name="d4f0" id="d4f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                He now lay, dizzy and growing warmer as he felt the blurry city
                lights slowly subside into the darkness, the roar of cars over
                and around him.
