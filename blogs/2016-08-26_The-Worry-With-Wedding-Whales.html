                For the software start-up, finding product-market fit and
                achieving a scalable customer acquisition process are the
                be-all, end-all. It’s hard to imagine having solved for these
                two major hurdles without feeling like the hardest battles are
                behind you.

                Of course, then comes the growth race, which itself brings
                challenges as the leadership team grows, creating newfound
                struggles to pick a lane as perspectives diversify.

                While that phase of a company’s lifecycle is worth books unto
                itself, there’s one particular activity therein that seems to
                occur with enough frequency that it has become conspicuous to
                me: whale hunting.

                Ishmail is killing it. Ishmail has found product-market fit.
                Ishmail has scaled from dozens total to dozens per department.
                Ishmail could be cash-flow positive in seconds. Ishmail could be
                a lifestyle company for years.

                And, most importantly, Ishmail is beloved by, and now under
                immense pressure from, its investors.

                With the act of scaling through people and process underway,
                Ishmail must now find ways to succeed exponentially. Multiplying
                recurring revenue or marketshare, whatever the key metric, is
                now the month-over-month tablestakes for existence.

              <p name="b9ed" id="b9ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                So what does Ishmail do?

              <p name="95de" id="95de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Ishmail’s Sales team can expand to new regions. Its Marketing
                team can target new lead sources. Its Account Management team
                can pursue growth of existing accounts.

                But what of the product itself? Ishmail’s Product team now faces
                an existential dilemma. What’s next?

                Product can help grow the business by adding net new product
                features—features to qualify leads previously disqualified or
                convert opportunities previously lost.

                Alternatively, Product can expand the company portfolio with net
                new products—products that extend the company’s reach into
                adjacent markets or create new markets.

                Product could help the business move up or down market by
                expanding the target customer of your existing products. This
                often necessitates new features—sometimes, entirely new
                products.

                These are product-oriented solutions, though. And as many a
                founder will point out to us, Product isn’t thinking
                holistically: it’s only considering customer revenue.

              <p name="15b6" id="15b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                For Ishmail, as with any start-up, raising customer revenue is
                only one financial metric to push: raising capital is
                another—and the tactics required for each are often different
                and sometimes opposed.

                What if Ishmail were to attract a big-named customer and treat
                them like a partner? What if it can land a whale who it can use
                as publicity to generate demand? Marketing is a cost, but
                partnership? Partnership is a revenue opportunity!

                This is quite often a tactic that many founders lean on, and for

                Be it a partnership or a customer relationship, wedding a whale
                can bring with it a significant set of challenges. Like an ugly
                introvert wed to a beautiful extravert, the start-up can too
                easily fall prey to its insecurity.

                The resulting kneejerk can do incredible damage as the start-up
                veers its product roadmap to keep its partner or customer happy
                at the expense of everyone else, top customers and talent alike.
