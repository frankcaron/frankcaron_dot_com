                When I was young, my cousins and I oft played games of our own

                Deciding how to build our fortifications strategically became

                Medieval castles were often enclosed by moats to defend against
                attackers. Crossing a moat would slow encroaching soldiers down
                enough for archers on the walls to pick them off more easily.

                its’ support systems, SLAs, and office hours are specifically
                designed to ensure every customer call is answered by a human

                From the outset, the company invested significantly in support,
                and as a result it has developed a powerful reputation — one
                that every single new competitor (and even established
                incumbents) needs to rival in order to attract or retain
                customers that FreshBooks could otherwise serve.

              <p name="527c" id="527c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                As a result, many choose FreshBooks for its support alone — even
                when there are countless competitive products across the
                price-to-potency spectrum.

                The Takeaway
              </h3>
              <p name="57a3" id="57a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                So how do you build your own moat? There’s no simple answer, but
                I’m trying something specific with my own freelance business.
              </p>
              <p name="7966" id="7966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I’ve established a client policy that I’m deliberately enforcing
                during pre-sales as part of my moat. I never take on a client
                that won’t provide recurring business, even if that recurring
                business isn’t particularly lucrative.
              </p>
              <p name="f005" id="f005" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                How does that help my build a moat, you ask? You’re probably
                thinking that sounds more like a matter of cash flow and time
                management. And while those are indeed ancillary benefits, the
                main reason I’m taking this approach is so that I can develop a
                deep understanding of my client’s businesses.
              </p>
              <p name="b3c7" id="b3c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                As I work entirely with established businesses, I’ve learned
                over the last 10 years that businesses working with freelancers
                often have a difficult hurdle to overcome. By taking work
                outside, these businesses run the risk of hiring contractors who
                don’t know their product or their people or their prospects well
                enough to represent the company successfully — and who don’t
                necessarily care enough to develop that understanding and
                empathy.
              </p>
              <p name="58bd" id="58bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Many businesses, then, use freelancers only as gap-fills until
                they can hire full-time staff or for lesser tasks which aren’t
                as strategic.
              </p>
              <p name="e866" id="e866" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Thus, by having fewer clients but going deeper with those that I
                do have, I create a win-win situation for both parties:
              </p>
              <ul class="postList">
                <li name="10a6" id="10a6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">
                  I become a more efficient freelancer by developing better
                  context and a deeper understanding of their goals, their
                  products, and their pains, which allows me to produce better,
                  faster, and frequently
                </li>
                <li name="29ed" id="29ed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">
                  They begin to get more ROI for their investment on freelancing
                  and can keep less employee cost on their books without losing
                  any of the dependability and deep contextual awareness.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p name="6039" id="6039" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">
                This understanding — a direct result of the policy — is an
                effective moat. A new freelancer would have to get up to speed
                and build the same deep understanding and commitment to the
                business I have in order to win it.
              </p>

                It’s not a radically sophisticated strategy by any stretch, but
                by being aware of the need to build a moat, I force myself to be
                more deliberate and strategic in the way I run my business,
                which will increase long-term chance of success.

                Building a moat that competitors can’t easily cross should be an

                If you’re building product, be aware that you need more than
                just a novel user experience and a whiz-bang UI to last. If
                you’re delivering a service, understand where to spend your time
                in order to keep that customer in the future.
