                There are few people in my life that I have kept touch with for
                ages. I have been, and always will be, something of a ronin when
                it comes to friendship. A poor memory, and poorer appetite for
                social out-calls, have cast me—to some, I perhaps arrogantly
                presume—an “I wonder how what happened to him”, at best.

                fleeting as the mist over the Bay that had since receeded from
