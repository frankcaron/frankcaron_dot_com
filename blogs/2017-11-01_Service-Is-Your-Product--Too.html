                As it becomes trivial to manufacture an infinite number of
                different objects from an infinite number of blueprints which
                themselves are collaborated on by a near-infinite number of
                designers, the value of an object itself is lost.

              <p name="e405" id="e405" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Ultimately, Sterling’s thesis statement asserts that as this
                shift in value occurs, the way we perceive value, and how all of
                commerce, economics, and culture function will change as a
                result.

                It’s a bit heady, but as I was reading it, I couldn’t help but
                note the parallel between that world view and my own when it
                comes to software products.

                The same is increasingly true of software products. API
                platforms, SDKs, all manner of libraries from gems to packages,
                and the collective intelligence of communities like Stack
                Overflow make it increasingly trivial to build moderately
                successful software products.

              <p name="722c" id="722c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                When combined with even a ham-fisted approach to the science of
                design and iteration, even moderately successful products can be
                made wildly successful (albeit in the absence of ego-led
                development).

                The dev teams today are solving scale challenges that their
                forebearers couldn’t have imagined, to be sure, but when it
                comes to straight up “app” writing, putting together a software
                product that solves a problem is trending towards being as
                trivial as printing a 3D model with a 3D printer.

              <p name="ad7b" id="ad7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                But you can see this approach in many different places, in
                companies large and small; in the many organizations that
                prioritize and package Customer Success alongside the Boxed
                Product®.

              <p name="702e" id="702e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I get why many tech start-ups shy away from this as they scale.
                Scaling CS is very difficult; human resources are too often the
                only major cost centre for a software company, and with no other
                tweakable levers to keep the bottom line black, cutting back on
                people and divesting in people-centric operations seems an easy
                salve to the hard pain of scaling.
              </p>
              <p name="838a" id="838a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Alas, underinvesting in service has left many scaling software
                start-ups reeling as their businesses fail not only to generate
                customer referrals—a priceless commodity in an age when cost of
                acquisition rates for customers are soaring for everyone—but
                also to position themselves strategically and defensibly in a
                world where a disruptor can go from non-existent to
                market-winning faster than ever before.
              </p>
              <p name="5668" id="5668" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                That’s why Customer Success is such a critical differentiator.
                Particularly for B2B, great CS is both your viral marketing
                referral generator and your competitive differentiator.
              </p>
              <p name="e255" id="e255" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Think about it: it’s really hard to build a great team, and it’s
                harder still to equip and organize that team towards success.
                That’s preciesely why that service, when achieved, should be
                part of the product offering and should be as much a
                consideration of the product team as the features that dot the
                app we and our teams so slavishly put on the App Store day after
                day.

              <p name="a6d6" id="a6d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Indeed, I believe (and the industry seems to be reaffirming)
                that only those product companies that can pair the robotic and
                increasingly-automated production of their wares with service
