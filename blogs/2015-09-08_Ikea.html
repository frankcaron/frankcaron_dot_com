                Furious, she ripped herself away from my embrace. “Don’t fucking
                touch me,” she screamed with a venom that could have bored holes
                in the dust-covered kitchen tile beneath her would it have
                fallen from her mouth rather than been spit into my face with
                inhuman force. She stepped away hastily, nearly tripping herself
                on the half-built shelving unit that lay in pieces on the floor.

                Here we stood, a newly-unionized couple enjoying the first
                weekend of togetherness. We stared at one another for a moment
                in silence, her venomous ire dripping down my face in the form
                of sweat and a stray tear. Her anger began to engulf her: her
                face turned as red as the pits of Hell, her eyes burned with the
                fire of a thousand suns, and she clenched her fists around the
                house’s best wrench, no longer screwing dainty screws into
                untreated wood, as though it were my very throat.

                We stood at odds with one another across that pine-felled
                battlefield; wood chips and scattered debris punctuated the
                scene, signifying the great war that had taken place.

                As the dust settled, I caught her eye. Not a moment passed
                before her mouth went from ajar to fully open, giving way to an
                erupting, streaming spew of ceaseless and deafening noise. The
                spring sun beamed into the room as though it was the hellish
                rays of God’s own punishing eyes burning into my back at the
                beckon call of her demonic roar. The pine boards across the
                battlefield glimmered in the soon-summer light.

                Time stood still as she mouthed her discontent for my eyes to
                behold. Each word thrust from her mouth like an epee, carefully
                and precisely piercing my soul further and further with each
                strike. My soul fell as blood to the floor as it seeped from the
                unseen wounds, seemingly staining the wood as an everlasting
                reminder of my crimes against humanity.

                So began the ballet: she twirled about the kitchen, deftly
                dancing around the modern marvel of unfinished furniture, as she
                sung the song that would end the world in the name of deriding
                my very being. And when she was finished, nothing remained but
                the completed shelving unit which stood in all its miraculous
                beauty anew.
