                He listened for a moment to the quiet of the coast before his
                concentration was broken by the rattle-rattle-rattle of a
                martini shaker. Looking up to the bartender, his eyes met hers.

                “Beautiful night, huh,” she quipped with a smirk as rattle gave
                way to pour.

              <p name="9962" id="9962" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                He responded as she filled his glass again. “It really is.”

                She cast her dark eyes on him, and in them, he saw a glint that
                told him everything he needed to feel. In his head, he could see
                them together; he, the stud; she, the filly; the pair, destined
                for horseplay.

                A few more sips and glances passed between them as fast as the
                hours of conversation that followed before she finally broke the
                silence.

                His charmed grinned belied an inner fire that was immediately
                lit ablaze by her suggestion. She looked towards him
                seductively, and he summoned his courage as he stood and lifted
                himself towards her.

                As he approached her, a vivid flash of the future filled his
                mind. He could see them traveling about the world to see one
                another, to build the romance; he could see them growing closer,
                moving in together, building a life together. And amongst all of
                that, he could see nothing but the passion of the moment before
                him burning ever more potently as the days became weeks, weeks
                became years, and years became decades.

                In that brilliant moment, the two passionately embraced, a
                flurry of colours and fireworks circling and exploding from
                their lips—

                “Olivia!” Mom yelped from downstairs. “Get your butt down here
                right now. Quit horsin’ around!”

                Olivia let the two My Little Pony figurines drop to the floor
                next to her makeshift beach scene. She sighed at her own
                invented romance as she stumbled down the stairs and dreamed of
                boys and love and kissing and a reality that for her could only
                be imagined.
