                So what went down? Here’s the gist.
              </p>
              <p name="2a14" id="2a14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                In the summer of last year, researchers at Google found two bugs
                affecting just about every CPU in every modern computing device.
                They dubbed these bugs “Meltdown” and “Spectre”.
              </p>
              <p name="b305" id="b305" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                In the simplest terms, these bugs allow evil-doers to gain
                access to the very lowest level of your computer (the “kernel”)
                and to capture (potentially all) sensitive information stored in
                your computer’s memory, including data that you don’t upload to
                the internet.
              </p>
              <p name="c654" id="c654" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                This is a direct result of a specific hardware design approach
                championed by Intel, AMD, and ARM that allows processors to work
                faster by “guessing” what you’re going to do next and
                pre-performing some of that work in anticipation.
              </p>
              <p name="208a" id="208a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                While Meltdown reportedly affects only Intel chips, the more
                wide-reaching Spectre is so severe that it can’t even be fixed
                entirely without completely redesigned processor hardware.
                Instead, operating system companies like Microsoft, Apple, and
                Google had to issue performance-affecting software updates to
                patch the issue.

                Each of the two biggest players involved, Google and Intel,

                radically affect the way consumers, staff, and investors alike
                look at, relate to, and trust these two companies going forward.

                Having found the issue months before it went public, Google was
                in the fortuitous position of being the owner of the canary but
                not the coal mine. The company kept this information private at
                first and quietly fortified its own systems and products while
                taking its findings to Intel, AMD, and ARM immediately.

                In its response, Google understood that a big part of its
                audience is consumers, so it chose to communicate in a medium
                more approachable by that audience.

              <p name="1bf3" id="1bf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Google also understood that the issue was complex and nuanced,
                and that getting into the details for those interested will not
                only provide educational value but also assert a subject matter
                expertise that connotes both confidence and trustability.

                Importantly, Google addressed investors, consumers, and
                developers equally and in precise language.

              <p name="5c45" id="5c45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Intel, on the other hand, chose a press release, which addresses
                investors and the media but not consumers or businesses.

                Doing so left their message very open to misinterpretation,
                particularly given that their language is clearly geared towards
                investors and reads like an ask for exoneration rather than an
                explanation.

                In this case, Intel is at least partially in the wrong, and
                acknowledging that is an important first step. Over 75% of its
                response is spent articulating its lack of culpability. On the
                flip side, Google spends the majority of its response explaining
                what the company did to find and fix the problem as well as
                providing clear actions on what to do next as a user.

                What’s more, Intel’s response lacked an understanding and
                humility around the encircling conversation. The company didn’t
                initially address the major negative speculation around its
                CEO’s dubious stock sale, and that conversation now hangs as a
                cloud over the company thanks to its lacklustre follow-up.

                Leaks are bad news for most companies, but when a damaging issue
                leaks, it can do even more damage to lay unaddressed.

              <p name="484b" id="484b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I think it’s pretty clear in the reporting and the writing from
                Google and Intel that Intel was trying to coordinate a specific
                release, likely timed around the release of fixes by the big
                players in the space as well as concern for investor impact.

              <p name="a6f3" id="a6f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                In this case, there’s good reason to remain silent and
                secretive. Letting the world know about this exploit before it
                is fixed will only cause more collateral damage.

                But once the word was out, Intel should have responded
                intelligently and immediately. Google was, instead, the first to
                respond, and this pole position gave Google the leg up in the
                media fallout that followed. It took Intel another entire
                business day to respond, and the press release hit the wire
                painted with the haste of reaction — not thoughtful
                premeditation.

                Had it considered any or all of these in its response, Intel
                likely wouldn’t have had to scramble to avoid a
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">meltdown</em> born by the

                could’ve made all the difference.
