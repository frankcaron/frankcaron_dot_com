                There was a time, years ago, when I wrote religiously. As vital

                Each night, post obligation, I would return home to my paper, to
                my solace, and scribe. Sometimes, I’d spend minutes; sometimes
                hours. But each day, without fail: scribe.

                Paper became therapist—vessel for dealing with the day’s
                tolerated injustices. I was ruthless. No detail was spared; no
                name left unnamed, no blame spared from shame. In my
                instantiated fiefdom, I reigned.

                Detective Constance picked up the letter and examined it. She
                thought little of it as she surveyed the rest of the scene. Just
                another “tortured artist”, she thought to herself. How could you
                even call these people artists? They worked normal jobs. They
                pursued none of their true latent ambitions. They were the very

                hollow tragedy for today’s shift.
