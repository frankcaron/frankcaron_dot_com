                She’s sitting across from me right now. Jet black short hair.
                Harsh cheeks. Dark liner. Green army jacket. You know the type.
                She’s on her Lindsay Weir trip, and I’m loving every second of
                it.

                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Freaks and Geeks</em> was
                such an underrated show. I wonder if she’d be into it, too. The
                good stuff always ends too soon.
              </p>
              <p name="1fd0" id="1fd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                She’s curled, knees up, on the wooden bench that sits along the
                coffee shop’s warmth-fogged glass: Americano-to-go in one hand,
                crumpled thrice-read copy of “<em
                  class="markup--em markup--p-em"
                  >Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit</em
                >” in the other. The maple tree behind her is just beginning to
                blossom for the season, small buds as brightly colored as her
                pink lips.
              </p>
              <p name="c109" id="c109" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I’m trying to study her but I think I’m doing so with all the
                subtlety of a busker in 14th Street station.

              <p name="8783" id="8783" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                She looks like she didn’t go out last night. Just my type. My
                mind is racing. I’m actively concocting an entire Tolkien-tome’s
                worth of lore about her and her past. She prolly works at
                Buffalo Exchange, but not in a sad way. She loves fashion but
                the old stuff. She has an LP collection and a record player,
                inclusive of Nat King Cole and Bobby Caldwell but also Sza.
                She’s prolly a Capricorn.
              </p>
              <p name="f5e7" id="f5e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Oh no. She just looked at me. Fuck. Did she notice that I was
                staring at her?
              </p>
              <p name="2457" id="2457" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Did she clue into the fact that I was about to shift from
                writing the backstory to the active plot line wherein we catch
                eyes and the book drops from her hand into the formed puddle
                below her from the tears of joy she cries in that moment when
                she realizes she too has met another Milhouse?
              </p>
              <p name="9930" id="9930" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Did she too in this moment recall Murakami’s “On Meeting The
                100% Perfect Girl?” and realize that we once knew each other and
                we vowed to forget each other and our eternal love as a test to
                prove that, if it was truly eternal, we would again find one
                another, years and lives later, and once again return to that
                abyssal wash of sheer euphoria?

              <p name="f598" id="f598" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Oh. No. She was looking at a cute dog that just barked behind
                me. I guess that moment we just shared was mine and mine alone.
              </p>
              <p name="16d5" id="16d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I wonder if she’s waiting for someone. She looks comfortable as
                she’s turning the pages. I hope she’s lonely. No, well, okay. I
                don’t mean that. I just want to marathon a show I don’t care
                about with her three blankets and two chip bags deep, you know?
              </p>
              <p name="4314" id="4314" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The cuffs on her tan slacks are so neatly folded, sitting there
                all high and mighty like a rich preppy Upper East Side Dalton
                School fuck, but like a cool one because they’re resting on top
                of her black-and-white Jordan 1s.

                I gotta say something. Maybe if I just clear my throat and then

                Oh no. She’s getting up. She’s walking away! This is it. I have
                to do something.

                I watch as she turns the corner, fleeing away from me and toward
                the swarming mass of the city’s bodies and cars and buildings
                and adventures and romances and tragedies, just another
                apparition in the crowd.
