                This morning, I studied Literature. I must’ve read the same
                paragraph a thousand times over. Fatigue had set into my eyes.
                You know the type: that burning hot singe from cornea to corner,
                where you blink in a panic to relieve the pain only to find
                yourself looking at the word “what” on the page before you as
                you are suddenly rendered immediately and completely illiterate
                in that brief lid-borne dark respite, scarcely comprehending how
                such arbitrary scratchings on a page and guttural sounds forced
                from gullet could amount to a word virtually impossible to
                define yet so permanently trapped in the gutter of our
                collective understanding.

                Eh, she wouldn’t like that I’m saying that. Then again, she’s

                own music and her own thoughts. She’s surely longing for that
                same change of scenery. She’s working harder to get it, though.

                Japanese life simulator video game players do this. I’m

                I should be going to the gym more. My trainer keeps telling me
