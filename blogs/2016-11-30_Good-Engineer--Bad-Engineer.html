                Good engineers are a thing a beauty—they can change the course
                of a company’s history.

              <p name="1419" id="1419" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Good engineers don’t just realize the dreams of a restless and
                reactive entrepreneur but deliver resilient, scalable solutions
                to real business problems.
              </p>
              <p name="0e92" id="0e92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Good engineers don’t architect novel constructs of obtuse,
                cutting-edge technologies simply to test their own mettle. Good
                engineers forge forward on unwalked paths to provide elegant and
                brave new solutions to problems previously unsolvable.
              </p>
              <p name="a968" id="a968" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Good engineers don’t rebuke customer feedback but rather whittle
                and lose interest in their work without it. Good engineers want
                to build software that is used, that solves a problem. Good
                engineers want to build for their customers, not their peers.
                Good engineers want to be recognized by the customer, not (just)
                the engineering community.
              </p>
              <p name="1940" id="1940" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Good engineers push back on product managers who don’t deliver
                enough market intelligence to make strong engineering decisions,
                who spend more time on the solution than on the problem, who
                fret over button colors before business value.
              </p>
              <p name="3c72" id="3c72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Good engineers don’t push back on deadlines: good engineers set
                their own, with good process and practiced estimation and
                tense-but-healthy negotiations with product and among
                themselves.
              </p>
              <p name="217c" id="217c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Good engineers push back on leadership who don’t provide a
                well-concieved and clearly-articulated roadmap—one that gives
                them the foresight necessary to succeed in planning. Good
                engineers demand more vision, more focus, more clarity, more
                specifics — not more runway.
              </p>
              <p name="a858" id="a858" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Good engineers change everything, not because they build the
                future but because they are the optimists who can always find a
                way to solve a problem. Good engineers turn a company’s doubt
                into its belief.
              </p>
              <p name="4e57" id="4e57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Good engineers have a better effect on morale and company
                culture than any amount of free food and unlimited vacation ever
                could. Good engineers will keep you from taking vacation because
                you’re kicking too much fucking ass to want to stop.

                But good engineers have a fatal flaw: they are hamstrung by bad
                engineers.

                Bad engineers are quite often excellent developers. Bad
                engineers have written some of the best code the world has ever
                seen—there are bad engineers at Uber, Google, Facebook, and in
                every company I’ve ever worked at. Bad engineers are everywhere,
                as are bad product managers.
              </p>
              <p name="d7b0" id="d7b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Bad engineers prioritize elegant solutions over solved business
                problems. Bad engineers drive decisions by threat rather than
                consensus. Bad engineers don’t collaborate: they dictate.
              </p>
              <p name="aebf" id="aebf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                But worst of all, bad engineers don’t realize that the single
                most important skill of an engineer, whether it’s software or a
                physical structure, is communication and execution as a team.
              </p>
              <p name="e13b" id="e13b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Bad engineers value code over cooperation.

              <p name="78e7" id="78e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                A single engineer does not build a 1,000 year old building that
                withstands age and act of God alone, nor does a single engineer
                build a software platform that can stand the test of scaling
                from a couple of customers to a couple million.

                Bad engineers kill dreams, kill passion, kill morale, and kill
                companies — more than any other function in the business. But
                damn, do they build some great fucking software.
