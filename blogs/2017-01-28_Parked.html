                “So, here’s what we’re going to do,” he said with a smirk. They
                stood together, thirteen floors above, looking out over the
                city. “We’re going to play a game. We’re going to go for an epic
                walk together, and we’re going to search the city for a cool
                little memory. We’ll each find one, and we’ll each write a
                little story about it. Sound like fun?”

                A smile drew on her face slowly and with clear trepidation, but
                her eyes belied her reserved expression. Who is this guy, she
                thought, and how does he do this?

                “No,” he retorted. “We’ve got to find something more unique than
                that. It can be anything: a simple rock lodged in a plain old
                road, a nondescript house, whatever ignites that creative fire
                within you and gets you putting pen to page effortlessly.”

                He motioned to the city around them, visible in all its glory
                from the spanning glass windows that encased his condo. It stood
                proudly, with occasional clean-lined obelisks rising high into
                the sky and humble hovels dotting the streets between.

                With the sun beginning to set, the two began their adventure.
                The talk of the walk was exploratory, as the two began to delve
                deeper into themselves, souls ajar but not yet agape.
                Cautiousness abound as the exchanged continued, neither wanting
                to prematurely open the floodgates that would lead to triumph or
                tragedy. It was a dance that had gone on for months and a dance
                that might continue for months further.

                Their walk took them on a tour of a nearby borough as they moved
                from side-street to side-street in the hopes of escaping the
                main routes. The conversation ebbed and flowed naturally, and to
                his delight, it was earnest and frank — enlightening.

                After a few hours and with the night’s close quick approaching,
                the two cut through Kensington Market. As they traveled through
                the area, they came upon a monument of sorts in the form of a
                broken-down car. He stopped to observe the site as strangers
                streamed by.
              </p>
              <p name="4560" id="4560" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Producing his phone from his pocket, he carefully framed the
                picture. The car lay in rest, dull silver paint slowly growing
                duller, with its front axis up on blocks. Masking its age was
                the plethora of graffiti, which gracefully hid the aluminum
                body’s wrinkles and scabs. From the inside, two evergreen trees
                sprouted, escaping the windshield’s mock canopy in search of the
                sunlight provided by the sole orbiting celestial body, a street
                lamp.

                He began to wonder what the story could be. Perhaps a man’s long
                journey to the city from some far away place ended here, and his
                car was left as a memorial to his journey. Perhaps it was the
                home of a street artist who worked diligently to bring color to
                our otherwise-gray world. And perhaps it was just an abandoned
                car that the locales decided would make for a great canvas, a
                showcase of Kensington’s flower power sensibilities.

                It didn’t matter. The story had already been written for him
                from the moment she arrived that night. As he snapped the
                picture, he spoke to himself aloud.

                amongst the other passers-by.
