                just years early, this application was immensely more powerful.
                With simple tools, you could create complex animations, and
                those complex animations could then be shared as videos that you
                could run on your computer — or a friend’s.

                He’d begun to tinker with it, and it was at that point — with my
                own computer fascination — that I set out to beat him at just
                one thing: this Windows application from a company named
                Macromedia titled “Flash 2”.

                Over the next eight years, I would develop an obsession with
                Macromedia’s magic. I read books. I scoured the young internet.
                And I experimented. I learned, in earnest, to animate with it,
                and later to code with it as the tools for front-end animation
                turned into tools for back-end software development.

                Suddenly, my simple animations could actually be used to create
                complex programs, and to take input and process server-side
                actions. Suddenly, my websites went from being static visual
                “pictures” to fascinating, interactive movies and games. It was,
                in no uncertain terms, a revelation.

                This is our universal truth. We as humans don’t just genetically

                literally all of our known biological peers, but we uniquely and
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">consciously</em> fear it. We
                don’t sit up late at night with one eye open to avoid physical
                danger; most of us do so out of mentally, and entirely,

                on myself now to “do a good job” and to be “better, better, [if]

                2020 was a reminder not to travel as soon as you can or do what
                you love or stop smoking or lose weight. It wasn’t a reminder
                that

                Rather, 2020 was a stark reminder that these immortality
                projects we create for ourselves are more prisons than
                passions — and the sooner we can all understand that, the sooner
                we can start changing our behaviors to be softer on each other
                and perhaps more importantly softer on ourselves.

                This was a fucked up year, and beating ourselves up for it with
                polite promises or overbearing oaths to improve isn’t going to
                help us. Rather, we need only take a breath, take a break, have
                a smoke or a bourbon or a burger, and try to remember that you
                can’t control much beyond how you feel about your present moment
                and the people who make you who you are.

                I struggle with that every day, and I’ll continue to do so, but

                those around me. And if we all just did the same, that would be
                a damn good start to what I hope will be a better back half of
                this decade.

                grief you went through or pain you suffered. I hope the year
