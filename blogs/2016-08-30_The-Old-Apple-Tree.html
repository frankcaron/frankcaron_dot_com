                The sun struck her as she sat there. Its strong, summer rays
                warmed her face as his food warmed her tummy. The tree had been
                in full bloom this season, and his children were ripe and
                delicious. It was with great eagerness that he gave her his
                fruit. She had made a habit out of visiting him, of climbing his
                limbs and dozing off for a midsummer nap in his arms now and
                again. He couldn’t have asked for a better friend.

                Of course, he would get cross occasionally when she accidentally
                trampled one of his saplings, but all was forgiven moments
                thereafter when she’d giggle and apologize. The love was
                unquestionably mutual, unconditional, and would have been
                everlasting.

                She’d first found him when he was still young. Her family had
                moved to the area at the behest of her ailing grandmother; she
                needed them to help her survive, so her family made the tough
                decision to leave their comfortable familiarities and head to
                her Nona’s bedside.

                While it was a sad time for her family, it was a happy time for
                her. She was too young to become absorbed by the maladies that
                had befallen her family. All she knew was that when the sun was
                high, the grass was green, and the wind was tame, he would hold
                her in his arms and life was perfect. Even in her youthful
                innocence, she somehow understood and capitalized on the notion
                that ignorance was bliss.

                One warmer autumn day, she decided to pay a visit to her old
                friend. Winter was coming, and she knew he wouldn’t be able to
                play any more. He’d have to go to sleep. For the entire day, she
                climbed and swung and ate. He nourished her, entertained her,
                and watched out for her. And she loved him for it.

                As the sun set, she made her way home. Down the hill she
                skipped, stopping for but a moment to look back at the apple
                tree she so adored. But her happiness turned to sadness as her
                skip turned to a trudge.
