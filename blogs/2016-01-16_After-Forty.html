                Jonathan looked down at his empty glass, it a fitting metaphor
                for his life.

                His most recent sales trip had been a disaster. He was convinced
                that he was mere inches from crossing the finish line with the
                prospect — a handshake away from vacation, and a break, and
                another lease on life.

              <p name="d693" id="d693" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                But as had often happened in his life, the deal fell apart in
                the final hours. His post-secondary degree, his marriage, his
                self-started business venture — he was used to it. At 42, he
                felt the best was behind him.

                He motioned to the bartender for a top up. The order was quickly
                fulfilled, as the bar had drawn barren with Boston’s morning sun
                mere minutes from poking its head through the frosted, wintery
                windows of the dive bar.

                As he approached with the glass, the bartender smiled warmly and
                spoke softly.

                afterhours place? It’s where service folk go when the morning
                comes and we’re off work. Generally a bit over the top, but it

                Jonathan let his entire drink slide down his throat without
                restraint before nodding in acknowledgement. “Sure, what the
                fuck? Let’s do it.”

                When Jonathan awoke, he heard the sqwaking of what sounded like
                a parrot. He felt strangely hot given that it was supposed to be
                winter. And rather than honking horns and Boston accents, he
                heard a meek whisper of a breeze and the gentle wash of water
                draping over sand.
              </p>
              <p name="606b" id="606b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                As he struggled his eyes open, he saw an unknown but
                pleasant-looking woman lying next to him and, next to her, the
                waves lapping at the beach just outside the door at the foot of
                the bed, which stood open and welcoming to the gorgeous
                landscape before them. He was stunned.

                “Morning, sunshine,” she said warmly. “Please tell me you’re not
                leaving already.”

                He quickly scrambled out of bed and grabbed his wallet and phone
                from the dresser. Trying to piece together what had happened, he
                immediately lit up his phone, where he had waiting for him a
                single text message from an unknown number.
