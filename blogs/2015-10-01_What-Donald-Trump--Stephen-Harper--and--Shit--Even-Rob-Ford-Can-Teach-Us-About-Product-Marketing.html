                Just like Slack. It’s clear within seconds what you’re going to
                get when you click “Sign Up For Free”: a hip, modern workplace
                where “slacking” is good for morale and productivity.

                And so therein lies the final point of consideration: having
                such a call to action paired with a clear cut message, even if
                it divides the audience and divides your potential customer
                base, and even if it denies you some sales from those who would
                want a more even-keeled positioning, is actually for the best.

                Clarifying the call to action, and embracing “what you see is
                what you get, so if this what you want, let’s do this”, is key
                to galvanizing the action you’re calling for.

                Then again, I suppose the fact that I’m not voting Conservative
                nor would vote for Trump if I could undermines my whole
                argument, but let’s just conveniently ignore that.

                No article espousing the virtues of the mad could do so without
                firmly ignoring some key facts, amirite?
