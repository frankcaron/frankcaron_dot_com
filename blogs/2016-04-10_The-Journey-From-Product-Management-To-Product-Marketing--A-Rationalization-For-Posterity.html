                If you at all follow the tech space, you’re probably wondering
                why someone would want to give up the “illustrious” Product
                Manager role.

                Indeed, my soon-to-be-former role is oft considered the crown
                jewel of the product dev team, the title to end all titles, the
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">intersection</em> of biz and
                tech and design, the most impactful role in a business outside
                the C-suite themselves.

                And for the most part, the talent market agreed with that
                assessment. The last decade has seen all manner of engineers,
                over-schooled MBAs, and waterfall project managers seek out a
                way to move into the role I now leave.

                But after about 5 years, I’ve learned that the role is nowhere
                near as glamorous as many think. It’s a hard role to do well in
                and a harder role still to repeat.

                lines and flat designs over customer use cases and functional
                efficiency.

                And so, a separate Product Marketing Manager, focused on the
                market and the message, seems to be the perfect complement to
                the Product Manager focused on the product and the process.

                That’s not to suggest that both shouldn’t understand the who’s
                and why’s of the customer, nor that both shouldn’t fully
                understand the what’s and how’s.

                But helping the market learn how a product solves a problem is a
                very different goal than helping the customer actually solve the
                problem.

                There’s an analogy I’ve worked out for myself as I’ve
                rationalized the role ahead of me and what I see myself being
                able to contribute in it.

                Apple doesn’t strongly message and advertise the iPhone’s home

                The home button is a requirement born by product management and
                engineering to solve for a problem the customer didn’t know she
                yet had.

                But when Apple messages the iPhone, when it advertises, it
                communicates the act of spinning around with your phone during a
                video chat as though your distant love was in your arms.

              <p name="90a4" id="90a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                The message to the market, then, isn’t so much about the feature
                as it is the problem that the iPhone solves for: boundless
                communication, togetherness, comfort.

                Understanding that and helping the market understand that, I

                It’s the message and the audience and the “why” the PMM
                understands and communicates to complement the medium and the
                product and the “what” that the PM understands and builds.

                And while PM’s success is measured on the success of the
                product, PMM’s is measured on the success of the market’s
                understanding of the product and, more quantifiably, the
                market’s willingness to help others understand it, too.

                All told, the business of product development has continued to
                unfold before me as my career has progressed, and while the post

                that fool you: I’ve no idea how this will all pan out.

                Nevertheless, I look towards my new opportunity as the next step
