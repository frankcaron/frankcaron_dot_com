                The information age is both rife with potential and fraught with
                peril for organizations of all sizes. While we are in an
                incredible era of prosperity and opportunity, wherein companies
                can solve bigger problems faster than ever, these same companies
                are now required to evolve at breakneck speeds and to treat
                their knowledge as a first-class asset equal to the money in the
                bank and the butts in the seats.

                have, in many cases, caused companies to test, learn, and
                iterate effectively but without considering the incredible cost
                to the business that not persisting said learnings can have.

                As a result, as employees come and go and the product or
                services evolve, most organizations are inevitably left in a
                rough spot:
                <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"
                  >key knowledge leaves the building or isn’t properly shared

                So what can companies do? Capture, organize, and manage that
                knowledge before it leaves the company and support searching and
                finding it when necessary. Doing so doesn’t have to add needless
                overhead or boring work, though, and the ROI becomes very
                readily demonstrable once the processes are in place.

                But that’s not where the story ends. Capturing knowledge and
                referencing it is only the most basic return on the investment
                of a good knowledge management strategy.

                Once the people and process is in place, a great CIO, COO, or

                Creating Single Sources Of Truth
              </h3>
              <p name="da89" id="da89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                There’s a concept that I always fall back on when it comes to
                planning and implementing knowledge management strategies, and
                it has yet to do anything other than help companies succeed.
                That concept is the single source of truth.
              </p>
              <p name="b5ca" id="b5ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                I come from a software development background, so by trade, I
                hate repeating myself and I hate doing the same thing twice.
                Those dislikes informed the approach I’ve taken to knowledge
                management, and subsequently led me to form a few key concepts,
                including the aforementioned.
              </p>
              <p name="db59" id="db59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                So what does the concept of the single source of truth entail?
                It’s pretty simple: in the spirit of
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"

                  >DRY</a
                >, there should exist no duplicate source of truth for any one
                piece of knowledge.
              </p>
              <p name="c840" id="c840" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                That means that when you begin capturing knowledge in your
                organization, and you begin to direct other teams to reference
                that knowledge, there should only exist one sole place for any
                one data point.
              </p>
              <p name="0e46" id="0e46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                For example, if a company keeps product pricing information in
                SalesForce, that should be the only place considered the source
                of truth. No investor deck, sales pitch collateral, internal
                email, or IM chat is right if the number is not what is in
                SalesForce, and should the number change, it is changed (by a

              <p name="7d2c" id="7d2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                This approach ensures that, in very little time, people begin to
                both trust and rely on the knowledge persisted rather than the
                knowledge transmitted orally or informally. That trust
                reinforces the knowledge captured and reinvests everyone in the
                process of keeping that knowledge up to date (the essence of
                shepherding).

                With that concept in mind, it should become more clear how this
                is actually a huge challenge for most organizations, but by
                making this optimization, you create huge opportunities to
                dramatically overhaul existing processes and tools to pay
                dividends in ways that go well beyond reducing departure
                liability and improving inter-team communication.

                Consider the following case study, based on a real customer I
                worked with. While the name of the organization has been

                the company in question.

                Lionheart was looking to hire a tech writer to fill out the
                user-facing help of its brand new product. The company’s user
                testing revealed that its users were still having issues
                understanding why they would want to use some aspect of the
                product and had trouble using some of the more advanced tools
                that enabled the product’s ultimate value proposition.

                When I went in there, they were simply looking for 6 months of
                work to fill out the initial base of content. I naturally
                inquired about the product’s roadmap, and I learned that they
                were planning to continue to iterate after launch based on real
                customer feedback. A great strategy, you’ll say, and that’s for
                sure. I, of course, asked what I thought was an obvious
                question: “What happens to the content you paid for me to write
                after that?”
              </p>
              <p name="2947" id="2947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                They had no answer. Ultimately, the product team conceded they’d
                have to hire again, probably in 6 months time, to backfill the
                missing documentation needed by new features and update the
                previous doc for updated ones.

                Given that they didn’t have any significant user help section in
                the current product, I asked how they supported customers today.
                “We have a customer support team that answers calls and emails”,
                I was told. The resulting dialogue speaks for itself and is

                The company didn’t have a user experience problem; it had a
                knowledge management problem. Lionheart was not stepping back
                and looking at how knowledge streamed into the company, where it
                could be captured, and solving the root problem rather than
                bandaging it. And, importantly, key information in the company
                had no single source of truth other than the heads of the
                customer service people, who weren’t empowered to share that
                info with the rest of the company.

                The development impact was tiny, and the cost to the company
                wasn’t much more. But the result was huge. The company’s
                Customer Service process radically transformed. Call times went
                down, and once the knowledgebase was integrated into the product
                directly, calls went down as a whole.

                A community began to blossom within Desk.com, and suddenly,
                customers themselves were submitting best practices. This
                resulted in the company moving forward with a new customer
                ambassador initiative which continues to this day.

                This then went on to inform the company’s sales process, as
                well. By referencing Desk.com, the sales team could better
                understand customer pains across a wider group as conversations
                stopped focusing on minute problems with the tool and began
                focusing on bigger problems with the customer’s actual pains.

                I love telling that story for obvious reasons, but to be
                truthful, not all of the wins that come from investing in
                knowledge management are that huge. That said, the story is
                demonstrative of the kind of ROI that can be born from the
                opportunities that capturing and organization knowledge
                effectively at both macro and micro levels within an
                organization can have.

                By treating knowledge as a first-class citizen and investing in
                both the organic processes and the people to drive the knowledge
                capturing, you can ensure that your business has the knowledge
                it needs recorded to reduce liability and dramatically improve
                cross-team communication, especially when you create single
                sources of truth.

                Once those processes are in place and your company’s knowledge
                can be drawn on as a tangible resource, stepping back and
                finding the optimizations is the kind of activity that CIOs or
                COOs dream of, and that’s the kind of activity that can drive
                huge value for the business while making every individual
                contributor’s life easier in the process.
