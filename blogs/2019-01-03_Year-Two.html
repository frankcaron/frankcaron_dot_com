                I was sitting in a boardroom meeting with two coworkers and two
                senior representatives from a potential partner. I won’t name
                names.
              </p>

                There was a pair of awkward, white floor vases filled with
                plant-like-but-definitively-not-plants “sticks” which framed
                either side of a dormant Xbox One tethered to a sizable Toshiba,
                which itself had a penchant for making the resolution of any
                connected computer so damn high that each meeting invariably
                started with ten minutes of “go to your Settings” followed by “I
                know, these 4k TVs, I tell ya. I saw a good deal at Costco…” and
                ultimately a “People on the bridge, still on the line?”.

                The room’s centerpiece was a wooden table which bore the kinds
                of stains that at first blush suggest it had seen some serious
                boardroom brawls over the years but was in fact merely
                representative of the fact that no one saw fit to clean up after
                themselves when spilling coffee in a meeting. Thankfully, the
                lingering faded black trails of marker which couldn’t be erased
                from the whiteboards that adorned the walls around complemented
                the table’s dark veneer.

                The goal of this poorly-organized meeting (as I came to
                understand it mere moments before it began) was to determine how
                exactly this potential partner would help us execute on a
                specific product opportunity we were exploring.

                Prior to this meeting, in the absence of any concrete
                information about the use case, I had done weeks’ worth of
                research: customer discovery, value proposition design, pain
                quantification, use case definition, total address market
                valuation, competitive analysis, minimum viable product
                validation, roadmapping—more work than anyone else involved by
                at least dozens of hours.

                By this point, I was advocating for the shelving of this
                particular enterprise. The economics had way too many flimsy
                assumptions; the

                was suspect; we’d not yet found meaningful validation; and we
                were nowhere near clear on the what, why, and who to bring a
                partner into the mix.

                Suffice to say, I wasn’t into it, and those that know me will
                tell you that a Frank disengaged is a Frank disembarking.

                You may then be able to imagine both my face and my mindset
                when, as the meeting started, our first discussion point was not
                of the customer nor the pain nor the use case nor even the
                economics but rather the technology—the
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how</em> to a
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what</em> and for a
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">who</em> that we didn’t
                understand nor could articulate as a group uniformly let alone
                individually and (or) intelligently.

                That the meeting diverted a moment later towards discussion of a
                side letter to sell crypto in a quantity large enough to warrant
                both a private plane and the giant duffel bag of cash which was
                then set down on the boardroom table only served to punctuate
                the end of the sentence for both my product career and the

                As was the central thesis for Year One, I saw 2018 as the year I
                would finally embark on doing what I wanted to do: tell great,
                impactful, and catalytic stories professionally.

                Doing biz dev and lead gen for effectively a “content” company
                simply isn’t my cup of tea, and that amounts to 90% of what you
