                Excitement is why your employees get up in the morning, why they

                Excitement is why they will accept less salary, less notoriety,
                less stationary. Excitement is why they won’t care about having
                the corner office, or vacationing to Switzerland, and saying
                goodbye to friends who work outside of your company.
