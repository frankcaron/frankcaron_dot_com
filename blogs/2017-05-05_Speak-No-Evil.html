                Sometimes, the ironies I encounter in my life seem so
                ridiculously well placed that I’m almost tempted to believe in
                fate. Normally I don’t feel that everyone’s “path” is mapped out
                by some greater power, but rather we’re all meant to experience
                X amount of a given life event: disappointment, victory, defeat,
                love, etc. However, on days like today, it’s hard to ignore the
                coincidences that life always seems to manifest.

                What am I talking about, you question? Well, today was my 22nd
                birthday, and it was today that I finally realized how “real”
                life is in the fair city of Toronto. I know that sounds strange,
                but it was only today that I really realized where I am in the
                grand scheme of things and how the world really is. What’s
                strange is that my day — and perhaps even my year — was defined
                by a single solitary passing of about 30 seconds or so on the
                bus ride home today. The event which I am referring to was over
                before I could even appreciate what had happened, and yet the
                reprecussions of what happened would leave me thinking about so
                much.

                A somber, lonely and long day of work was coming to a close. I’d
                accomplished a pretty fair amount during my time at the TDSB
                today, and so I was feeling fairly good as I storde out of the
                office and into the Sun. Though the day was coming to an end, I
                couldn’t help but marvel at how long it had been. It seemed like
                years ago that I woke up at 6 am and headed to the GO Train. It
                seemed like ages ago that I sat in Union awaiting the next ride
                east at the hands of the cancelled 7:30 train. But, all this
                thought was for not: the day was over and I was heading home.

              <p name="85a3" id="85a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                As I headed into the Scarborough RT station, flashing my pass to
                the attendant, I noticed a young slender girl in front of me.
                Her body and manner seemed young, but her face appeared old and
                tarnished with the apparent wear that her life wrought upon her.

              <p name="f824" id="f824" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                She proceeded down the stairs in front of me, and continued to
                shadow my path right up to the very bus stop where I needed to
                wait. We stood together, in silence, and we boarded together,
                seperately. I sat on one end of the three-person bench, she on
                the other. I surveyed the bus, as I tend to do, and my eyes fell
                upon hers: a smile was shared and then instantly hidden again in
                the frown of every-day life.

                As it does most days, the bus began rolling along the urban
                rails of the Scarborough mid-town. People returned to their cell
                phones and their conversations, drowning out my thoughts. I
                occasionally decide to head to the station without my music
                on — days that I want to play the DS on the train, I tend to
                forego the music for battery life, and with my recent acquiring
                of Contact, I decided today would be such a day. Typically, this
                proves to be a bad decision, as the bus quickly fills with the
                sounds of angsty teenagers, angry and eager-to-impress urban
                trogldytes and the typical array of “bus characters”.

                Strangely, none of the typical characters were there: the guy
                who picks up the trash on the bus, the crazy old man who talks
                to himself, the young asian kid who sells chronic over the phone
                as though he was making legitimate business calls, the old brown
                woman who absolutely cannot stand and will go out of her way to
                find a seat at the front of the bus, the strange skinny tall
                white woman who stands at the front of the bus and bottlenecks
                the incoming passenger traffic regardless of how many stops she
                has to go, the slutty high-school chica who comes on to a
                different prepubescent boy with each ride — all were absent on
                this day.

                Indeed, it seemed that today’s ride would be the most dull and
                quick trip of the year. For almost the entire trip, the ride was
                relatively easy and I remained positioned a seat down from the
                worn girl.

                Eventually, the bus came to the biggest stop on the circut:
                Bellamy and Ellesmere. Typically a very large transfer point for
                people getting on and off, only one person boarded: a mid-20s
                asian thug with a small mp3 player hanging from his neck and an
                all-around rugged and dishelved appearance. I wouldn’t have paid
                any special attention to him were it not for the fact that he
                broke the cardinal rule of male bus-goers: he sat in the middle
                seat between the girl and I, thus rendering me — and surely
                himself — uncomfortable.

                Within moments of the bus’ resumed driving, the man turned to
                the girl and quickly looked her over. As he was within earshot,
                I could hear everythign he was saying — despite the fact that he
                was doing his best to speak privately to the girl (regardless of
                the current surroundings). He began talking to her, and
                naturally I began ease-dropping. They hadn’t shown any signs of
                acknowledgement of each other before he sat down, so I wondered
                what the story was. Given the relatively impersonal tone that
                their conversation took to begin, I concluded that he was merely
                trying to woo her with his asian thug charm.

                After a few short sentences of conversation, I quickly realized
                that their talk had taken a turn for the worse. His mumbling
                became much less audible, until he uttered the sentence that
                would stick in my head for the rest of the day.

                At first, I did a mental double-take. Did he really just say
                that? Was it a joke? Are they friends and he’s just playing
                around? When I saw her face, though, every question was
                answered. Tears piled up along the rims of her eyelids, and a
                gush was ready to burst the weak damn of her frail composition.
                Her eyes hinted with a slight touch of disbelief and she looked
                towards the bus driver, as though she was looking for a safety
                net.

                The asian was quick to remove any such luxury from her mind,
                though, as he looked towards the bus driver and scoffed, “He
                won’t be able to stop me. It’ll be done before anyone notices.”

                He then paused and looked towards a big white gangster-looking
                guy in an Echo jacket towards the front of the bus, only to
                remark to her “Even that big cracker won’t be able to stop me.”

                At this point, I’d heard and comprehended the entire situation,

                slipper-criminal alerted the bus Ian and I were on that he was
                robbing us. A surge of adrenaline and a rush of quick planning.
                Should I say something? No, it isn’t my place. Yea, but that’s
                not right. And if he has a knife, or a gun? I really doubt that
                he does. Well, say you say something and a fight starts; good
                luck taking this bus unscathed for the rest of the semester — my

                luxury of having; it paid to be a big guy today.

                Not one to look away, I stared right back at him for what seemed
                like an eternity. Sensing her desperation, I allowed my eyes to
                shift back to her, and then him again, noticing that he’d locked
                on me and seemed to offer no chance of letting go. I then looked
                towards the big white gangster guy who the asian had called out
                earlier, and he looked back at me — he was aware of what was
                going on, and had heard the cracker remark.

                Not a single word punctured the tense air. The asian followed my
                eyes and then smirked. He stood, fixed his mp3 player, tapped
                the girl on the face and then headed for the front of the bus,
                saying thank you to the bus driver before looking back and
                exiting the bus.

                With door closed and bus in motion, I looked towards the girl.
                Her dam finally burst and she began sniffling and quickly
                swabbing the tears from her eyes. The white gangster
                relinquished his interest and returned to his cell phone, but I
                wasn’t so quick to let the preceeding air dissapate. The entire
                bus was oblivious to the goings-on.

              <p name="25e5" id="25e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                It was now just her and I.

                I couldn’t help but watch her cry; it was such a surreal
                moment — perhaps the most uncanny of my entire life. It was then
                that I realized how sheltered my life truly had been. What crime
                had I seen? What reality had I ever witnessed?

                They say that games and movies desentize you to violence, but it
                was only today that I truly realized how much of a crock of shit
                such a belief really is. I saw no violence today, but merely the
                threat and feeling of impending violence was enough to jar me
                out of the complacency, the naivity that shrouded my life.

                It was only today, on my 22nd birthday, that I realized just how
                real the world is. For all I know, that girl could be dead now.
                All for just a bag of coke, or a turned-down trick.

                Her sadness engulfed me, and I felt incredibly ashamed of not
                being able to do anything. With eyes still locked on her, she
                turned to me and sought consolment without saying a word. I
                mustered a short blast of speech into the air, though quickly
                locked up not a moment later: “Are you okay?” Unable to produce
                any vocalization of the terror and fear that was so visibly
                evident in her quaking frame, she simply nodded and resumed her
                tears. It was then that I recalled I had some kleenex in my bag,
                so I reached in and passed her a handful. She dried her eyes,
                but they remained so only for a moment before the next tide
                commenced. For the remainder of the trip, not a word was said.
                To me, it seemed as though the once fury-inducing air pollution
                of the bus chatter had grown silent: all that remained was my
                incredibly loud thoughts.

                My stop came and I got off, never once letting my eyes fall off
                the girl. She didn’t look back, even as the bus passed over the
                horizon: never looking back, just staring ever-forward as though
                she’d already been killed and buried.

                So was the trip home today; a tiny incident that had huge
                reprecussions. Surely my pathetic prose cannot be eloquent or
                vivid enough to document such an epiphany. I’m no Joyce. I’ve
                spent too many words on this already. I’m tired.

                Unlike previous years, I have no giant recap and projections for
                the coming year; that complacent routine has been rumbled right
                out of me. Perhaps I’ll say something tomorrow, perhaps not.

                For now, all I can think about is the look on that girl’s face.
                The look of hopless, utter desperation — forever stained on the
                canvas of my mind — tjat looked so frightening familiar, as
                though I’d seen it somewhere before, looking back at me.
