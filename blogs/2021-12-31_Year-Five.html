                I dreamt of another annum house-arrested, with its blessings and

                a year wherein the pomp and circumstance of seeing history
                live-streamed gave way to the banal reality of broken
                government, of wealth disparity, of not just a country but an

                in the immortality projects, as mirages, that lay beyond the
                infinite darkness surrounding our pale dot.

                supporting a decentralized framework at global scale in complex

                without uniform, global government support if not outright
                regulation. There will be no other impetus for individual actors
                of centralization to change; the free market continues to favor
                the less costly and riches-generating reality of centralized
                computing.

                Our young emissaries of Switzerland and Greece did their duty:
                the former, promises of bountiful fortunes; the latter, of
                boundless feasts. And between them both stood marvelous
                mountains of snow, dotted with cheese-laden chalets. So formed a
                plan, years in the making and with yet years to come.

                sleep later as we clothed ourselves and set off, south down
