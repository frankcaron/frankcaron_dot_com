                It may sound cliché, but all too often we downplay the
                authenticity of real-life experiences deemed “too melodramatic”
                when in fact those around us live the lives we see on screen
                every day.

                flatbread I was eating took two days to make, and suddenly, it
                went from mere cooked food to complex fabrication.

                The lot of them — Jacob, Simon, and Sara — had dazzled me, and
                the staff at the Citizen are due whatever success they’ve had
                and will have as a result of what can only be considered a
                young-and-hungry attempt to make a mark on a scene that is
                increasingly competitive and increasingly challenging.

                The rest of the meal, and the night, stands in a haze of
                three-cheese, cornflake-topped mac and chorizo, superfood salad,
                deep-friend tequila shots, and from-scratch strawberry-banana
                sorbet.

                And while the food was great, it was the fact that, in just a
                few hours, I’d learned so much about the business and the people
                in it that I found myself starving — not just for more of the
                food but for the chance to meet and learn from amazing people
                like Jacob and Simon and Sara.

                I can’t wait to meet more food folk and hear about their stories
                and successes and suffering and obscure spices.

                That’s exactly why I started this new blog: to profile the food
                and friends and families I’m setting out to meet as I dive
                head-first in the restaurant biz to learn and grow and
                appreciate.
