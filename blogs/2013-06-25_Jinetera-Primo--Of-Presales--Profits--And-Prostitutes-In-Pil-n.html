                On a road trip in Cuba, my friend, Chinese born, and I, of
                Italian and French-Canadian descent, learned that we were born
                of the same mother. We were both offspring
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">jinetera</em>, and our birth
                took place on a long, sweltering night to which Pilón, a distant
                dwelling of ne’er-do-wells, and her prostitutes played host.

                If not for that night, the voyage was unremarkable. When we
                graduated, we decided to reward our four-and-change years of
                lackadaisical study and half-hearted home-writing with a trip
                abroad. The ritualistic university celebration of a single meal
                featuring all of
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">KFC, Taco Bell, </em>and
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Pizza Hut </em>would no

                We decided to head south. It was something of a mandatory bucket
                list item for our country’s youth to travel to Cuba in search of
                sugarcane and stogies. And so we went, as had many before us and
                as would many after.

                But, in service of our quest as entitled millenials to feel like
                unique snowflakes, we opted not to head the northern shores of
                parties and playboys. We went to neither Varadero nor Havana.

              <p name="6bf7" id="6bf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                No, rather, we headed south, to Marea del Portillo, where the
                uncharted and quiet shores were oft the secluded setting of
                hotel-bound honeymoons and romantic rendezvous.

                would trade, and we may never return but for spending the

                While we thought we were to some extent veering from the beaten
                path, not even in the distant and uncharted (read: not Google
                Mapped) south could we avoid the trappings of a Cuban vacation.
                The food was foul. The service was suspect. The sea was salty,
                the sand stinging hot, and the wildlife wily.

                The week passed slowly. There was little worth recalling. That

                As part of our all-inclusive vacation package, a number of
                “tours” were offered. These pre-arranged events generally
                included travel to a particular location, a meal and walking
                tour at that location, and a trip back from that location.

                The last of the tours we’d arranged seemed harmless at first. We
                were to go on a road trip of sorts a few hours from the resort
                to a small city for a party in the city’s center square. There’d
                be music, drinking, and dancing.

                We’d heard from our mutual friend prior to leaving for Cuba that
                this was the single best event at the resort; it was, as he
                said, the Cuban equivalent of a “club night.” We knew little
                more than that before we were off on a bus to the city, towards
                the looming darkness.

                The bus ride was boisterous. Our fellow travelers cheered and
                reveled in the carefree nature of an all-inclusive trip; booze
                flowed freely from cups to mouths and bottles to cups as my
                companion and I sat next to each other, surveying those that

                The most outstanding cast members had to be the extremely
                outgoing French-Canadian family hailing from just near Ottawa.
                The nuclear-plus-one family, with two sisters and a brother born
                to the mother and father, had come together for a week’s
                respite.

                In stark contrast to the francophones was an oddly
                Chinese-looking couple and their son from Kazakhstan. The
                seven-foot-tall, Army-bound son would bear the nickname “Yao
                Ming” for the duration.

                Further stretching the race pool of the cast were two estranged
                black girls. The locals evidently viewed them as a fine, exotic
                African dish to be consumed with extreme preference. They bore
                the nicknames “Alicia” and “Keys.”

                Lastly, of course, there was Lau and I: the odd yellow and white
                man combo. We were appointed the nickname of “Harold and Kumar”
                when together, and I was referred to as “Tony Soprano” when
                alone.

                That effectively sums up the important cast. There were a few
                other secondary characters, such as a family with a father who
                looked exactly like a latino Michael Bay (ergo, “Miguel Bay”)
                with a quartet of attractive girls, but none played a big role
                in the affair that followed.

                We were released from parental supervision to find ourselves
                dropped in the middle of a foreign, dark, and foreboding city
                square. While the resort’s coastal beachfront property felt safe
                by virtue of its defensible proximity to water and to the
                buffet, the city we now stood in was remote and bizarre and
                surprisingly lacking in wireless connectivity. Siri, as usual,
                was of no use to us.

                Making matters worse was the fact that, shortly after we’d had
                but a moment to take in our newfound surroundings, the bus
                driver spun up the engines and began driving away, his airborne
                words of “we’ll be back in four hours” blown back in our
                direction by what I can only assume was the sound barrier
                breaking as he sped off.

                We beheld our surroundings, which revealed that we had been left
                in the middle of a huge town gathering. A cavalcade of locals
                crept about the city square. Yao Ming, having somehow gathered
                intel prior, informed the group that the gathering was a weekly
                custom of the local townsfolk.

                We moved unconsciously, as if puppets of some unseen puppeteer,
                towards the sole lit area before us. A lonesome set of tall,
                tapered, dark metal lamps illuminated the interlocking brick
                circle that lay in the center of the town square. The pedestal
                of sorts was slightly elevated and surrounded by waist-high
                concrete blocks.

                The dark townscape that engulfed us seemed designed specifically
                to force us toward the light. Rickety houses made of broken clay
                tiles and shoddy woodwork, lacquered with peeling paint and
                laced with poorly-potted plants, dotted the outskirts. In the
                scantly-illuminated windows leered darkened faces and in the
                quiet air hung darker whispers.

                An hour had past before our sheer discomfort led us to break off
                from the group. A single, seemingly-harmless local boy had begun
                feeding drinks to the troupe we’d travelled with. A beer cost
                only the equivalent a $1, and as such, they flowed freely and
                fearlessly. Mambos and sambas had already begun to decline into
                mumbles and stumbles.

                once we were free from the square, we felt far less ensnared.We

                Some 500 feet from the square, we came upon a small bar. The

                weren’t open with each other about our mutual nervousness, as
                young men rarely are, but we also both subconsciously felt a

                And so we became jineteros. Sam taught us what we needed to
                know; we needed to sell the beers for two CUC$ instead of one,
                pocket the difference, and return both the bottles and the bonus
                to the Jinty.

                We had an advantage the locals didn’t; the tourists knew us,
                trusted us. This was a valuable weapon that we could use to win
                sales, and so, swept up in the notion that we could become
                hometown heroes, we went to work.

                In just a few hours, we sold and salvaged enough bottles of beer
                to qualify as a foreign Molson plant.We’d even, though I’m

                Our strategy was remarkably simple. We reintegrated ourselves
                back into the group, and as we danced, we offered to be the
                shepherds for beer. No one wanted to leave the circle or stop
                dancing, so we’d little problem convincing people to be the
                hostesses. In fact, in addition to giving us the extra coins for
                each beer, some even tipped us further.

                Working in concert with us, the local Jintys played the role of
                distractors. One of the Francophone girls was
                all-but-impregnated by Carlos, a sly Cuban dancer who put on a
                salsa clinic as he dragged the poor girl along with him while he
                performed his picture-perfect dance. We easily crept around
                picking up bottles while the tourists clapped along blissfully.

                the Cuban young men flocked to them and serenaded them with

                offers of drinks for we gave them asylum from their suitors, if

                Even Yao Ming got a little attention, as his awkward and
                never-ending frame tilted and swayed with the rhythm of the cute
                Cuban girls who fancied his footwork. He couldn’t be bothered to
