                It was about 6:45 when she pulled open the old glass door of her
                usual coffee shop, bells breaking the morning quiet with a
                jingle that announced her arrival. She quickly met eyes with her
                usual server, and he smiled at her warmly as he, without prompt,
                began to prepare her usual coffee.
              </p>
              <p name="bbdd" id="bbdd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                With a deep breath, she took in the sweet smell of coffee beans
                and warm milk, it dulling the edge off of the coolness of her
                breath which she could still see before her. Her eyes closed
                gently as her lips curled slightly, and she shivered as the
                outer cool gave way to inner warmth.
              </p>
              <p name="dad8" id="dad8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                As she waited to begin, she surveyed the shop around her. It was
                like all of and none of the others in the city, she always felt.
                It was hers, on her little corner, in her little part, of that
                big ol’ city.

                The walls were adorned with newspapers from ages long lost.
                Every morning, she’d read a new one and learn about an old Aunt
                who’d won a knitting contest in the town that week or a
                successful rescue of a cat from a tree by the local fire
                department or a 25 year sentence for some nefarious banking
                tycoon.

                She’d read each story a thousand times by now, but each time she
                relished the chance to read one anew. She took comfort in the
                familiarity but also always found something new, to take note of
                and to like and to learn.

                Today, she read about a local romance. There was an anniversary
                celebration in that paper from that day. Celine and Jesse
                Montgomery; married, 45 years. The two had met somewhat later in
                life, but they enjoyed a whirlwind romance of the type that
                would have otherwise only come to a couple twenty years their
                junior. Now, aged 75, the pair spend their days tending to the
                grandchildren and entertaining the lazy old dog.
              </p>
              <p name="cce7" id="cce7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                She smiled as she imagined their life. They were long dead by
                now, but she could just picture herself walking up to some
                brownstone in the neighbourhood and seeing old Jesse stubbornly
                fixing the front porch light. She could picture Celine opening
                the door to bring him out a glass of tea. She could picture the
                two then stopping for a good sit as morn turned to eve, content
                and happy and complete.

                A knowing grunt beckoned her to turn to her server, collect her
                coffee, and move to the window seat she always sat at. She
                placed the coffee before her as she took her seat on her stool
                and produced a book from her bag.

                Her ritual.

              <p name="2170" id="2170" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                She began by opening the book to the page last curled, which she
                immediately straightened beyond recognition, before clutching
                the book in her left hand. She’d lick her right index finger,
                and then with smooth motions: scan, shift, scan, turn; scan,
                shift, scan, turn; scan, shift, scan, turn. It was rhythmic,
                fast, satisfying.

              <p name="2ccc" id="2ccc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Her feverish attention would be drawn in stray moments to the
                people outside, strolling past, living their own lives. She
                liked watching them. She liked being ignored by them. She liked
                being seen by them.
              </p>
              <p name="f79e" id="f79e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                But best of all, she liked being noticed by them, say by the
                unusual he she always sees, who tends to catch her dark eyes
                with his and for only but in that moment, each day, the two
                shared a lifetime in a look before he disappeared again into the
                crowd.
              </p>
              <p name="a203" id="a203" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                She sipped her latte and stared at the crowd and flipped her
                pages until ritual’s end. And as she did every day, she sighed
                ever-so-perceivable as she recycled her cup and left with the
                same jingle to which she’d entered.
              </p>
              <p name="10b0" id="10b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                But she’d be back again tomorrow, and again thereafter, willing
                slave to the ritual and to the book and the window and its
                protection from the hurt that lay beyond their walls.

                  restautants and coffee shops. Its success has been largely
                  driven by the company’s consumer-first approach, which it
                  follows Uber in executing successfully on: it makes the
