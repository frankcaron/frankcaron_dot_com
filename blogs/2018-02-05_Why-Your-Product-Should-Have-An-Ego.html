                This is particularly true when it comes to putting a product

                huge impact.

                William Knapp Buckley, the mixed collection of mostly-natural
                ingredients offers to consumers none of the sweetness or
                smoothness of other brands but at least equal efficacy.

                So what makes Buckley’s so remarkable?
              </p>
              <p name="6247" id="6247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                From the moment he invented his foul-flavoured brew, Buckley
                infused the product with an ego—a strong sense of self-awareness
                and self-esteem. And that’s been evident from the very moment
                that product was first announced to the world through to its
                major market position of today.

              </h3>
              <p name="9109" id="9109" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                With such a strong sense of self identity, the product’s
                go-to-market strategy was quite clear: Buckley simply had to let
                the product be unabashedly proud (and loud) about what it was.
              </p>
              <p name="53d0" id="53d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                From day one, the message to the market was profound and
                arrogant and outright astonishing.
              </p>
              <p name="27a0" id="27a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                In bold print on the Classifieds section of the Toronto Star,
                Buckley headlined his product with but two words: “<a
                  href="https://torontoist.com/2012/10/toronto-invents-buckleys-mixture/"
                  data-href="https://torontoist.com/2012/10/toronto-invents-buckleys-mixture/"

              <p name="bd40" id="bd40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                With the market’s attention caught, his announcement continued
                with the kind of bravado that we might imagine the most
                egotistic speaker trumpeting:
              </p>

                That’s what Buckley’s White Bronchitis Mixture is doing every
                day. It is curing Bronchitis, Coughs, Colds, Bronchial Asthma,
                Hoarseness, when all other remedies failed. I sell it under an
                iron bound money back guarantee to cure any of the above
                ailments. No cure no pay. Can I do more than this to prove to
                you its wonderful healing power? Ten times more powerful than
                any known cough cure, acts like magic, one dose gives instant
                relief. Never wait for a cough or cold to wear off. It wears
                away the lungs instead. There is none just as good.

                until the company’s current, timelessly, proud, and resonantly

                The story of Buckley’s success is well known. In an industry
                where new disruptors were as rare in 1919 as they are today, the
                company’s ego-infused vision, product, and marketing led it to
                resounding success in its early days.
              </p>
              <p name="ead6" id="ead6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                Even after falling into a slump during the 70s, the company’s
                “Bad Taste” campaign rekindled that sense of ego and resulted in
                a marketshare increase of 10% in Canada and catapulted the brand
                into the global marketplace with similar and massive success in
                the Caribbean, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S..
              </p>
              <p name="4ff9" id="4ff9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                By 1992, Buckley’s became the number 1 cough syrup in Canada,
                and by the 2000s,

                The Takeaway
              </h3>

                In spite of the brand’s messaging clarity and unique
                positioning, there exists no truth to the company’s claims.
                Buckley’s is not any more effective than a spoonful of honey,
                let alone any other brand’s product.
              </p>

                The company’s claims were, from day one, as they are today:
                unsubstantiated and ego-driven.
              </p>
              <p name="b935" id="b935" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                But that ego continues to provide the company with a clarifying
                rallying point for its product and marketing efforts, and to to
                this day, the company’s product development remains resolutely
                focused on delivering against ego-centric proclamation.

                Perhaps no one boils down the lesson to learn here better than
                Buckley’s itself:

                In our complex and constantly changing world, consumers are
                looking for demystification and simple effectiveness in the
                things they buy, and the Buckley’s® product line offers just
                that.

                The beauty of Buckley’s use of ego here is in its ability to
                articulate that very clear, crisp takeaway with a confidence
                that inspires action in its consumers and creators alike.

                Ego may be a bad thing for presidents and politicians, but it
                can do wonders for your product.

                Give your product a little ego and let it boast about being
                really good at something: doing so will let you more crisply
                articulate its promise to the market while helping you focus on
                delivering that promise in parallel.
