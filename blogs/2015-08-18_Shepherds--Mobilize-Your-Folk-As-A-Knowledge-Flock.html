                The information age is no longer a novel tomorrow; it’s firmly
                our collective today. To that end, the vast majority of this
                age’s employees, across industries and verticals, are knowledge
                workers. Their output is not a physical product but rather a
                brokerage of knowledge, data, or insight.

                And yet, though we’ve been living and breathing knowledge and
                data for years now, many companies remain ill-equipped to deal
                with the challenges that accompany this new world of work.

                If you think about traditional companies with traditional assets

                everyday examples where strong companies mismanaged assets.

                Few great financial companies of old hid money under the
                mattress; rather, they invested and diversified to yield
                returns. Few great agencies and firms sat on burdensome real
                estate; rather, they bought and sold and expanded and contracted
                to address the bottom line. And few great merchandise companies
                sat on product or accepted inefficient processes; rather, they
                refined and relaunched to address the market’s wants.

                So why then do so few great knowledge-based companies treat

                This is a question I’ve struggled with for my entire career, and

                In my experience, modern companies treat knowledge as a
                second-class citizen. In the ongoing war for product and talent,
                knowledge has fallen by the wayside, to most companies’
                detriment. And while the costs therein may not be as readily
                visible on the ledger as are other profit and loss metrics, poor
                knowledge management is as much a liability to the business as
                would be putting your entire leadership team on an aging
                propeller plane over the Atlantic in a thunderstorm.

                This is, of course, because knowledge management is generally
                viewed as unsexy; it’s much like accounting: all business
                leaders know they need it, but few want to be the ones to own
                and solve for it. I think that’s because they don’t know how to
                execute a strategy around knowledge management nor can they
                quantify the ROI expected thereafter.

                So how exactly do you action “write it down”? Do you simply ask
                everyone to literally write things down and enforce that no

                No. Instituting rigorous process like that will only add what
                your employees will instinctively see as “overhead”; and, even
                if they somehow get over that generally-insurmountable hurdle,
                simply having every employee write everything they do down will

                The trick to making that simple task work is to enable the

                These are all examples of tools that provide excellent baked-in
                ways to have your business produce documentation, and to capture

                leverage the info in these tools for answers, there will come
