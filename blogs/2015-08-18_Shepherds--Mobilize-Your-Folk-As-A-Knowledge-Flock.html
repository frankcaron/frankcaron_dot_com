                The information age is no longer a novel tomorrow; it’s firmly
                our collective today. To that end, the vast majority of this
                age’s employees, across industries and verticals, are knowledge
                workers. Their output is not a physical product but rather a
                brokerage of knowledge, data, or insight.

                And yet, though we’ve been living and breathing knowledge and
                data for years now, many companies remain ill-equipped to deal
                with the challenges that accompany this new world of work.

                If you think about traditional companies with traditional assets
                like cash, bonds, or real estate, you’d be hard-pressed to find
                everyday examples where strong companies mismanaged assets.

                Few great financial companies of old hid money under the
                mattress; rather, they invested and diversified to yield
                returns. Few great agencies and firms sat on burdensome real
                estate; rather, they bought and sold and expanded and contracted
                to address the bottom line. And few great merchandise companies
                sat on product or accepted inefficient processes; rather, they
                refined and relaunched to address the market’s wants.

                This is a question I’ve struggled with for my entire career, and

                In my experience, modern companies treat knowledge as a
                second-class citizen. In the ongoing war for product and talent,
                knowledge has fallen by the wayside, to most companies’
                detriment. And while the costs therein may not be as readily
                visible on the ledger as are other profit and loss metrics, poor
                knowledge management is as much a liability to the business as
                would be putting your entire leadership team on an aging
                propeller plane over the Atlantic in a thunderstorm.

                This is, of course, because knowledge management is generally
                viewed as unsexy; it’s much like accounting: all business
                leaders know they need it, but few want to be the ones to own
                and solve for it. I think that’s because they don’t know how to
                execute a strategy around knowledge management nor can they
                quantify the ROI expected thereafter.

                So how exactly do you action “write it down”? Do you simply ask
                everyone to literally write things down and enforce that no

                No. Instituting rigorous process like that will only add what
                your employees will instinctively see as “overhead”; and, even

                simply having every employee write everything they do down will

                Once you’ve baked in the process for capturing knowledge, or
                even if you already have those systems in place, there’s one
                more critical aspect that you need to invest in which you surely
                haven’t yet. I call them shepherds.

                Inevitably, your systems will begin collecting data from
                disparate sources in the organization, and each team will know
                its own info best. As cross-team collaboration evolves to
                leverage the info in these tools for answers, there will come
                the need to ensure two things:

                Many companies have tried to appoint a single person for this
                role: a tech writer, an information clerk, or what have you. But
                in an organization of today’s world which evolves, and needs to
                evolve, with great and unending agility, that simply doesn’t
                scale.

                Instead, employ the help of “shepherds”: people in the
                organization who hail from each function, are generally OCD
                about organization, and who can represent their team and
                shepherd their team’s data into green pastures of relevance,
                accuracy, and reliability.

                Unless you have some strong knowledge management folk in your
                organization already, you will inevitably get some push back on
                this approach, particularly if you try to assign shepherds in
                each department. After all, this is net new and strange work
                with no obvious added benefit to those who haven’t participated
                in this kind of initiative before.

                The key to uptake, then, is to communicate the same value prop
                to the business; make it a priority, a company goal. Integrate
                the process as you would a new company benefit program or major
                project. Give it top billing at a town hall. Make it central to
                bonuses. Integrate it directly into the company’s operations.

                Every time I do this, I like to integrate it into the company’s

                entertaining story, intertwined in actual company events, which
                sold in the value prop in a way that wasn’t so cut and dry. In
                another company, I demonstrated the value of the tool by way of
                a functional intra-office ping pong leaderboard example. In yet
                another, we were able to tie bonuses to participation.
