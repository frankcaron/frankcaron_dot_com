                opportunity and its capitalization therein. We love to lead from
                the front, and the best of us likewise love to have our boots

                And yet, for all our talent in applying these skills to our
                business’ output, we generally struggle to apply these
                principles to the business, and our business, itself. We rarely
                rise above the roar of action to organize ourselves more
                methodically for the greater theater of war playing out above
                the trenches we too eagerly toil in.

                war and scale, this is a fatal weakness, as with scale, as war,
                there become too many fronts to fight on effectively. And in
                that weakness comes failure: to grow, to evolve, to continue to

                As a sole product manager, or one in a very small group, it’s
                easy to act in the business’ best interest and remain effective.
                Divvying up the massive amounts of analysis, preparation, and
                decision-making into large, meaty chunks is relatively easy when
                you’ve but one lead and one set of troops to execute on larger

                the inevitable challenges of cross-team communication, are

                Ultimately, this strategy is informed by the desire to have the
                tactical “owners” play the role of the sergeants — fighting in
                the shit directly with the teams, focusing on execution, and
                ensuring that no one dies along the way — while the strategic
                “managers” assume the rank of officers — looking beyond the
                immediate skirmishes to the bigger battles on the horizon;
                fretting not about implements but about positioning and timing;
                pouring over key strategic analysis and investigation necessary

                  (e.g., where his fellow PMs are and how they’re fighting) and
                  can make sound tactical decisions with all fellow platoons in

                old sergeant who sits, pen and pad in hand, trying to make sense
                of a war that seems unyielding. Scaling a product team is hard,
                and the chain of command has existed, designed by smarter men
                for bigger wars.

                I’m left only to hope that, one of these days, in one of these
                wars, maybe I’ll finally make rank. ‘Till that day, though, back
